Apart from returning the text or a view rendered using blade templates, Laravel has ways to build our

00:10.220 --> 00:19.610
proper HTP response with all its features like response codes, setting cookies and setting response

00:19.610 --> 00:20.240
headers.

00:22.160 --> 00:31.610
For the purpose of this lecture, let's create Adami route with the fun slash responses you are I.

00:37.190 --> 00:46.310
Now, a lot of the way is to use its helper functions, the response function will create a new response

00:46.310 --> 00:46.970
object.

00:47.450 --> 00:52.910
This object has methods like header or kookie.

00:59.620 --> 01:06.250
The response function accepts the free parameters, all optional, first is the content to return.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.490
Second, the status code and third is an array of response headers.

01:13.750 --> 01:19.450
So why won't we return the Post's variable that we actually have in this file?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.420
But first, we need to use it for this function.

01:23.020 --> 01:25.330
So posts will be a content.

01:25.870 --> 01:31.780
Let's change the status codes to something else, maybe two hundred one and let's leave the headers

01:31.780 --> 01:32.320
empty.

01:36.050 --> 01:45.230
There, Heather Medalled says the response header like contents typed, for example, tying the browser

01:45.230 --> 01:50.510
what to expect from their content, whether it is HTML or JSON.

01:50.930 --> 01:55.580
So let's return something that would be understood as Jason.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.230
Now, Cookie says the browser cookies.

02:01.910 --> 02:06.480
Cookies are useful to keep users specific data on the browser side.

02:07.220 --> 02:15.680
This is used to implement features like User Session or are Remember Me feature of a logged in user.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.410
So let's set an example, Cookie with that.

02:19.640 --> 02:29.720
My cookie name, the value being my name and the cookie should expire after three thousand six hundred

02:29.720 --> 02:31.850
minutes, which is one hour.

02:34.430 --> 02:43.340
Now, let's get back to the status codes in all responses returned to status code, these codes have

02:43.340 --> 02:53.090
meaning the most common across the web is 200, meaning OK for all four meaning not found and 500,

02:53.090 --> 02:55.190
which is internal server error.

02:56.120 --> 03:03.080
Though with traditional websites, you'd rarely see anything but those free above when developing API

03:03.120 --> 03:05.630
is the full spectrum is useful.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.520
Take a look at the link from the Amde N.

03:11.630 --> 03:17.720
To read more about all the possible codes that you might use and encounter.

03:19.410 --> 03:26.130
So how using the response helper is different from using the view helper function, you might ask?

03:27.130 --> 03:29.740
When and why you should use which?

03:30.820 --> 03:37.720
That is simple use response helper when you need to do something extra, like setting a header or a

03:37.720 --> 03:46.150
cookie or change the response status code, by the way, the response helper function creates a response

03:46.150 --> 03:54.250
object, which also has the view method, which accepts exactly the same arguments as this separate

03:54.250 --> 03:56.160
view helper function.

03:56.710 --> 04:02.860
So you can also render blade views while adding headers cookies and changing the status code.

04:04.660 --> 04:13.360
There is also a simpler way to return Jassam done adding content type header explicitly, but will get

04:13.360 --> 04:15.220
to it in a couple lectures.

04:17.600 --> 04:26.960
Finally, let's see this in action heat, this farm slash response, says Eurorail in the browser,

04:27.470 --> 04:34.730
you won't see anything special, but if you open the network tab, you can see a different response

04:34.730 --> 04:40.630
code to the one we've sent all called response header.

04:40.640 --> 04:48.740
Is there the content type that we have said to application Jason and the cookie we've created called

04:48.740 --> 04:55.550
my cookie, which you can also verify in application type cookies on the left and during this?
