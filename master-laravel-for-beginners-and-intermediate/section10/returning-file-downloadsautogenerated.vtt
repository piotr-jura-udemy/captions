It's easy to force the browser to download a file.

00:05.080 --> 00:09.990
You can do that using the download method of the response object.

00:10.840 --> 00:18.180
So let's define our fun slash download route to try this out.

00:20.530 --> 00:28.930
We will be calling the response helper function that will return the response object and then we will

00:28.930 --> 00:31.540
call the downloads method of it.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.290
So the first argument is the path to the fire.

00:37.430 --> 00:41.570
Well, let's first get some file to download.

00:42.050 --> 00:49.160
So under this lecture, you will be able to download this image, make sure you copy it and in your

00:49.160 --> 00:54.830
project folder, go to the public folder and just pasted their.

00:58.030 --> 01:05.950
Now back to the code, so the first argument is the path to the file now to actually give the proper

01:05.950 --> 01:11.160
path to your public folder, you can call the public path helper function.

01:11.980 --> 01:19.050
And now inside it, let's just put slash Daniel Jabe jpeg.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.700
Well, the extension, OK.

01:25.210 --> 01:33.370
The second argument is an optional name, the user will see if it needs to be different from the original

01:33.790 --> 01:44.560
filename so it can be, for example, the face jpg and the third is the least of an optional headers

01:44.560 --> 01:45.520
to return.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.840
This is an array, so we won't add any additional headers.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.100
So let's skip that.

01:53.380 --> 02:04.660
Now we are done and we can try it out in the browser, so the URL is fun, download and to download

02:04.660 --> 02:10.930
should be initiated, but it might not be started automatically as this depends on your browser.

02:11.260 --> 02:16.380
You can see on the bottom that might download has actually started if you missed out.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.070
Let's see this again.

02:18.580 --> 02:25.840
I'll type the euro and watch the bottom as it gets downloaded automatically.
