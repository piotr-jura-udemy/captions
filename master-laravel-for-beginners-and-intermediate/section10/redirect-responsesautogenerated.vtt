Sometimes the route does not really need to show and response to the user.

00:07.550 --> 00:11.710
It just needs to do something and then go to another page.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.630
An example of this might be starting.

00:14.630 --> 00:19.770
Some new data are sent through a form or deleting something in the database.

00:20.540 --> 00:25.400
Sometimes you also have a year old that was moved to some other place.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.250
In all of these cases, you can return our redirect response.

00:30.890 --> 00:37.700
This will allow you to do some logic in the route and then just redirect to a different route or review

00:37.700 --> 00:40.770
URL that might actually render some content.

00:42.960 --> 00:49.540
So let's ask simple Getrude that will do a redirect to another page.

00:50.040 --> 00:50.630
There you are.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.960
I can be fun.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.730
Slash redirect.

01:03.210 --> 01:13.160
The simplest case is to use our redirect helper function, it accepts you or I, you would like to redirect

01:13.170 --> 01:17.730
do so we can redirect to our contact page.

01:20.230 --> 01:29.050
Now, let's try it out, hit this slash fan redirect IRL, and you are to contact Page.

01:30.290 --> 01:37.760
Now, notice that the very direct response will also have a different HTP code there, frio to.

01:41.990 --> 01:49.910
Now, let's go over this route, quickly changed the urai from redirect to back and remove the body

01:50.720 --> 01:55.640
now, but helper function will redirect to the last address.

01:56.090 --> 02:00.920
It's useful with one time actions like previously mentioned for input storying.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.710
So let's try it out from the contact page, let's hit Fun Slash Bach and you are back at the contact

02:09.710 --> 02:12.830
page, the same from the home page.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.720
Let's try to go to find Bach.

02:14.930 --> 02:18.020
And you are back at the home page.

02:20.540 --> 02:24.020
Now, let's copy the route again and change this.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.110
You try to named route.

02:30.750 --> 02:41.260
Now we have the first use case for our named routes using redirect and then calling the route matters

02:41.280 --> 02:42.780
onto created object.

02:43.670 --> 02:51.290
Now you can redirect to unnamed route, so you might remember that we have given our routes names,

02:52.040 --> 02:58.790
for example, the one responsible for displaying aspecific a blog post has this post show name.

03:02.930 --> 03:09.380
So it's enough to just know the Roots name, you don't really need to rely on the your eyes, which

03:09.380 --> 03:10.790
of course might change.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.270
So let's use the posts.

03:14.420 --> 03:21.480
Show routes and parameters can be passed as the second array argument.

03:21.830 --> 03:26.480
So in our case, this might be I.D., which is equal to one.

03:27.800 --> 03:38.150
Oh, save the changes and let's hit this euro slash fun slash named route and we are redirected to the

03:38.150 --> 03:40.340
post slash one.

03:44.010 --> 03:48.930
So let's do it again, Kopitar route, and this time let's use way.

03:51.060 --> 03:58.620
So that's the simple example, how to redirect away from your website so you can use the redirect helper,

03:58.860 --> 04:05.730
which has an away method, so you can redirect, for example, to our Google com website.

04:09.420 --> 04:16.260
So let's try it fun slash away and we are at Google.
