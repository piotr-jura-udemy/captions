00:00.850 --> 00:04.900
We've covered the way you will be reading the input most of the time.

00:05.320 --> 00:12.460
There are other interesting options for starting with a body unmetered that would return true for one

00:12.460 --> 00:15.200
as a number one as a string.

00:15.940 --> 00:16.630
True.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.550
True as a string.

00:18.550 --> 00:19.540
And then on.

00:19.540 --> 00:21.430
And yes, strings.

00:23.210 --> 00:32.960
Next, you can use except our only methods as means for blacklisting or widely seeing certain values

00:32.960 --> 00:33.920
from to include.

00:38.010 --> 00:47.850
The House method is used to check if the value or values as it accepts both string and array.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.860
Is present in input.

00:53.330 --> 01:00.090
Warehouse allows to execute some logic if specific value is present in the input.

01:00.780 --> 01:08.360
Now, it's useful to note that the opposite method of hahs would be the missing method, which is also

01:08.360 --> 01:09.020
available.

01:10.160 --> 01:19.400
Finally, there is also has any method available that checks, if any of the given values is present.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.990
Finally, the field method, it will return a Bolian value, true, if value is present and is not empty

01:30.990 --> 01:39.990
in the input, and then there is also one field that would execute some logic in the anonymous function

01:40.350 --> 01:43.170
when the field condition is met.
