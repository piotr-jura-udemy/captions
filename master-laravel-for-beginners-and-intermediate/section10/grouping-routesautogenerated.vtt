In the past few lectures, we have added a lot of roots and they all have the same common property,

00:09.640 --> 00:15.840
the same prefix slash farm in Laravel, you can group roots.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.030
This group Roots can share the same attributes.

00:19.960 --> 00:28.930
Groups of roots can have the same prefix, the same roots, name prefix or the same middleware applied.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.140
We haven't talked about the media word yet.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.930
So let's see an example we can understand right now.

00:37.840 --> 00:45.730
So let's give all foreign roots the same Eurail prefix and the same name prefix.

00:48.390 --> 00:57.600
Root grouping starts with calling the root class static methods, applying the common properties in

00:57.600 --> 01:04.440
our case prefix for the usual prefix, which would be fun.

01:06.740 --> 01:14.550
And name for the rude name prefix, in our case, let's use fun dots.

01:16.190 --> 01:23.120
Finally, we call a group that accepts an anonymous function.

01:28.270 --> 01:35.290
Inside this anonymous function, we now move all rude declarations that should have above parameters

01:35.290 --> 01:35.980
applied.

01:43.060 --> 01:55.030
Now, be sure to add the new statement for any variables from outside the context that post in our example.

01:57.410 --> 02:04.850
Now let's open the terminal and run a bipartisan route, at least to see all the route definitions from

02:04.850 --> 02:05.550
our up.

02:07.490 --> 02:12.410
Now you should see that all the fun routes have the fun prefix added.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.990
So now we have fun twice.

02:15.830 --> 02:21.080
And also the names have the fun dots prefix applied to them.

02:21.740 --> 02:28.460
So the final step in here would be to clean it up, which won't be fun actually, as we have to remove

02:28.460 --> 02:31.670
this fun prefix from all rude names.

02:32.720 --> 02:38.150
That's the whole point of grouping not to have to repeat the same text or same attributes.

02:38.810 --> 02:43.220
And also it would be decent to give all those roots are specific name.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.860
So I'll do that in this video.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.540
But we don't really have to watch this.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.290
You can grab the code from GitHub or just leave it as it is.

02:58.410 --> 03:06.450
Wolf, finally, so we can see this part wasn't fun, but not everything in programming is fun.

03:06.660 --> 03:09.310
So now let's see the list again.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.210
OK, now we have the prefix without specifying it explicitly for every route.

03:15.210 --> 03:20.930
And also we have the name prefix and they all look really nice right now.
