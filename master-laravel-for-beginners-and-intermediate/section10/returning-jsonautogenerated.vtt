00:00.470 --> 00:09.470
Sometimes you need to return only the data from the response without any HTML and in such cases most

00:09.470 --> 00:12.680
of the time you wanted in the Jason format.

00:13.910 --> 00:17.210
Let's try it out by defining our new route.

00:18.910 --> 00:23.830
Let's make this route available under fun slash Jason.

00:29.150 --> 00:39.620
Response object, Jason method is the easiest way to return a Jason response, we can return the Post's

00:39.620 --> 00:42.420
variable we have available in this file.

00:42.680 --> 00:48.560
First, we need to add the youth statement for it so it is available within this anonymous function.

00:49.850 --> 00:56.250
At the end of this course, you will find a complete section about making APIs that work with Jason.

00:56.720 --> 01:04.130
For now, let's see this in action in the browser and later in the API client called Posman.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.890
So the browser refers to let's hit this Farnsworth's Jason and Point.

01:11.180 --> 01:15.130
That's our Jason returned and now the postman.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.500
And this is our data.
