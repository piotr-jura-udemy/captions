There is one more thing that still remains to be done about deleting models and this is our tests.

00:07.410 --> 00:14.610
So as you know in our post test we are checking if the model works was successfully deleted and what

00:14.610 --> 00:20.850
we are using is our database missing which is checking whether the record was actually deleted from

00:20.850 --> 00:21.660
the database.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.240
So since we aren't deleting it anymore we are using self delete.

00:26.250 --> 00:31.170
So it is being marked as deleted but it stays inside the database.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.620
This test will fail but we also have another problem.

00:34.620 --> 00:40.800
So let's see what that would be by running the unit tests using the command you see on the bottom in

00:40.800 --> 00:46.920
the terminal so we see quite a lot of errors.

00:46.920 --> 00:53.490
So let's scroll to the actual problem and you can see that Eskew light doesn't support dropping for

00:53.490 --> 00:57.930
in case you would need to recreate that table.

00:58.020 --> 01:06.540
And this is happening in our app method for our recent migration that we have created to basically recreate

01:06.540 --> 01:15.700
the foreign key and it complains about this line so we can use our usual trick that we did before.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.190
It's it is just checking for the environment.

01:19.200 --> 01:29.280
And in case of the Eskew a light we just want to drop this for a key so let's just copy and paste it.

01:29.290 --> 01:35.140
And in this case we want to be checking whether it is a skill light testing we'll just check if it's

01:35.140 --> 01:35.500
not.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.800
So it will only work for our usual database.

01:38.800 --> 01:44.760
My sequel but for Eskew a light it just wants to drop this foreign key.

01:44.770 --> 01:53.520
Now let's rerun the unit tests and now we see that we have one failure and it is that our data doesn't

01:53.530 --> 01:55.540
match with what we expect.

01:55.570 --> 02:04.270
So we expect we expect not to find a record and it is actually found with the deleted out date.

02:04.270 --> 02:14.500
So this is happening here inside our test delete and what we can do for our self deleted models is instead

02:14.500 --> 02:22.230
of using us a database missing we can use another method assert self to delete it.

02:22.300 --> 02:28.880
Here you also have to specify a table name and then the data.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.260
So we already have that.

02:30.260 --> 02:32.050
So this would be posed to our array.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.050
Nothing changes here.

02:34.100 --> 02:40.900
Just make sure you will comment out this line and now take a look at the terminal.

02:40.950 --> 02:47.330
We'll be running unit tests again and they should be passing right now.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.320
Of course they do.

02:48.770 --> 02:55.160
So this is what you should use when you have solved delete double models and you verified that in tests.

02:55.160 --> 03:01.730
So instead of assert the database missing we check which checks if the record was actually deleted from

03:01.730 --> 03:04.790
the database we can use assert self deleted.
