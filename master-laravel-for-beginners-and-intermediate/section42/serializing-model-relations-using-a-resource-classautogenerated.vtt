In the last lecture we have introduced the resource classes to serialize your eloquent models.

00:06.930 --> 00:14.030
And maybe you might have noticed that I've misspelled the field name here and called it updated art.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.340
So this are the things that can happen.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.010
So this should be updated.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.970
And then of course you probably should have tests for that and into world covered up later.

00:25.020 --> 00:30.750
Now we were supposed to talk about how to load our relation because previously we had some data about

00:30.750 --> 00:33.810
a user that posted this comment.

00:33.810 --> 00:36.630
So this is actually very simple.

00:36.630 --> 00:46.950
So the naive way to do that would just to include a field like user I.D. or create a new key user and

00:46.950 --> 00:49.050
then specify an array.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.060
So it's very easy to do that.

00:51.060 --> 00:59.880
You can have this as we know that there is a user attribute on this particular model the comment because

00:59.940 --> 01:01.560
it has a relation to the user.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.560
You can do something like this.

01:03.630 --> 01:09.420
This user I.D. Now let's check if that works.

01:09.420 --> 01:10.470
Of course it does.

01:11.250 --> 01:19.080
But there might be a problem with this that well obviously let's see how we have loaded this relation.

01:19.200 --> 01:27.420
So we have loaded the post comments and does not this does not include any relationships of the comments.

01:27.420 --> 01:35.700
So what we are doing here is actually this will make a separate query to load every related user of

01:35.910 --> 01:38.820
every comment so that's not very efficient.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.740
We'll handle that later.

01:40.740 --> 01:49.710
But what we should do in the first place is create a separate resource for the user that has to be serialized

01:49.710 --> 01:57.360
together with comment because that's the whole sense of creating this resource classes that sometimes

01:57.420 --> 02:00.480
you might want to serialize things a little bit different.

02:01.020 --> 02:08.280
And in the case of the user associated with a comment we only want his I.D. and a name.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.920
So let's go ahead and create another resource.

02:10.920 --> 02:18.540
Call it beach be artisan make resource and let's call it common user

02:22.500 --> 02:24.710
so let's find this new class.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.240
It's here.

02:26.340 --> 02:33.960
And notice that this class is not actually really aware of what is the type of the model that it is

02:34.180 --> 02:41.370
serialization but whatever you'll pass to this class it will just assign older attributes of this eloquent

02:41.370 --> 02:43.780
model to this resource class.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.610
So we wanted the idea of the users.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.250
So let's return this idea and the name of the user

02:53.220 --> 02:54.780
so this name.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.670
So this is our comment.

02:56.670 --> 02:59.440
User resource class.

02:59.910 --> 03:04.140
Now you can import this class inside this particular resource.

03:04.140 --> 03:08.170
So use up HDP

03:10.890 --> 03:12.710
resources.

03:13.140 --> 03:13.990
Comment.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.340
User.

03:16.500 --> 03:23.160
Now you don't really have to apply as this as a comment user resource but maybe that would be just a

03:23.160 --> 03:24.220
good practice.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.240
Ask comment user resource.

03:29.300 --> 03:29.590
OK.

03:29.600 --> 03:39.290
Now instead of specifying explicitly how the user should look like what you can do is you can create

03:39.290 --> 03:42.890
new comment or use a resource.

03:42.970 --> 03:44.530
This user

03:48.680 --> 03:56.060
and now it is being serialized exactly how you wanted that and the benefit of that is whenever you will

03:56.060 --> 04:02.900
create another resource class for a user let's say you want much more information about the user you

04:02.900 --> 04:09.980
just create another resource class and use it in the place you would like to serialize this particular

04:10.010 --> 04:12.580
eloquent model differently.

04:12.590 --> 04:22.700
So I mentioned a problem that we actually have not loaded the user relation of this all of this individual

04:22.700 --> 04:27.560
comments and then we are making an unnecessary query.

04:27.560 --> 04:32.150
So in the next lecture I will show you how to overcome this problem.
