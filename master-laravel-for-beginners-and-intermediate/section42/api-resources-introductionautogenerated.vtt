00:00.780 --> 00:07.200
In this section we will learn about the much more robust way of serialize izing your eloquent models

00:07.230 --> 00:11.900
to J Some and this is called La avail resources.

00:11.910 --> 00:15.510
So first let's remind ourselves what we have right now.

00:15.510 --> 00:21.000
So we've created a simple API endpoint that returns all the comments of a blog post.

00:21.090 --> 00:27.210
What we have also achieved is we have hit in some fields that we do not want to be returned.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.700
And also we have included user relations so it's our domestically serialize.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.780
And we've achieved all that using the simple one liner where we just fetch the query and let a lot of

00:39.900 --> 00:41.310
do all the magic.

00:41.460 --> 00:49.170
And then we've used this hidden protected field to specify which columns we wants to be shown and which

00:49.170 --> 00:50.660
we would like to be hidden.

00:50.670 --> 00:56.270
So basically everything that's inside hidden property is not being displayed.

00:56.280 --> 01:03.270
So now let's go and see how we can achieve it much better and robust way using lot of our resources.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.920
So let's take a look at this resource concept.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.620
So it's actually extremely simple.

01:11.960 --> 01:18.040
So you will generate a class called the resource for every eloquent model that you have.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.350
You will generate at least one resource class.

01:20.360 --> 01:27.560
You can have many because what resource does it is deciding how to serialize your model and you are

01:27.560 --> 01:31.260
in full control of how you would serialize a model.

01:31.460 --> 01:39.110
For example you can not only decide how you will call the keys of this serialized object like here we

01:39.110 --> 01:42.580
are using just the attribute names of eloquent model.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.750
So you can modify that.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.050
You can also modify the values.

01:48.740 --> 01:56.390
So let us go ahead and create our first simple resource for the comment model.

01:56.390 --> 01:59.960
As usual a lot of it has a command to generate this code.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.700
So let's go ahead and do that.

02:02.600 --> 02:13.080
Open the terminal and run peach pea artisan make resource and let's call it comment so it was created

02:13.080 --> 02:19.230
successfully and now you can find those resource classes inside that up folder.

02:19.260 --> 02:21.450
Page GDP resources.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.460
Let's open up the comment resource.

02:23.460 --> 02:29.730
This is how it looks like it only contains one method to array in which you will define how you want

02:29.790 --> 02:32.200
your resource to be serialized.

02:33.420 --> 02:40.500
Now before we will modify this method let's first see how you should even use those resource classes.

02:41.010 --> 02:46.380
So let's go back to the post comment controller and the first thing you will have to do is to import

02:46.380 --> 02:47.500
this new class.

02:47.640 --> 02:58.630
So use up h DDP resources comment and it's a convention to import these resource classes.

02:58.630 --> 03:06.510
We found Elias us comment resource in case you will be using the eloquent model comment.

03:06.510 --> 03:10.130
This will let you avoid the naming conflict.

03:12.080 --> 03:20.750
Now let's go ahead and try to immediately use this new resource so mind that first we will try to serialize

03:20.750 --> 03:28.540
a single comment so I know that we are returning multiple comments but now let's try with a single one.

03:28.670 --> 03:37.760
So we return a new comment resource so you create this class and the only parameter it expects is the

03:37.760 --> 03:39.040
actual model.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.750
So it will then know how to serialize it.

03:41.750 --> 03:53.870
So we do post comments first so this will just give us the first element of the collection.

03:53.880 --> 03:59.010
So the first comment say the changes and now let's see what we got.

03:59.070 --> 04:03.390
So you might have noticed that it has changed a little bit.

04:03.390 --> 04:11.670
So the most important difference is now that the data is bankrupt inside our data field.

04:11.670 --> 04:14.520
So this is being added when you use resources.

04:14.520 --> 04:20.220
I will show you how to get rid of that later but that's the most important change and it is done for

04:20.220 --> 04:20.720
a reason.

04:20.730 --> 04:29.070
Because using the resources it's very easy to add some additional parameters like metadata or some links.

04:29.250 --> 04:34.560
And this is useful when you have collections because sometimes you might want to provide additional

04:34.560 --> 04:41.490
information how many items are in the collection and what are the links to get the next elements of

04:41.490 --> 04:42.510
this collection.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.160
We'll see that in a second.

04:45.210 --> 04:52.130
So you can see that currently we have the same data that we will have when we would normally serialize

04:52.140 --> 04:57.560
on the eloquent model by just returning it as an array from the end point.

04:57.780 --> 05:01.580
And this is because it is using the defaults that we have.

05:01.590 --> 05:06.390
So this will call to array on this element.

05:06.390 --> 05:12.870
So this element I mean that eloquent model that we have passed through the constructor so to overwrite

05:13.140 --> 05:22.350
how you serialize things we will return an array and now how to access the attributes of an eloquent

05:22.350 --> 05:22.920
model.

05:23.280 --> 05:31.400
So it is actually very easy you can access them using this so if you would like to return an I.D. you

05:31.400 --> 05:33.220
can use this I.D..

05:34.280 --> 05:41.910
So every attribute that is out there in your eloquent model is now available under this.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.600
So let's check that out.

05:45.100 --> 05:50.950
So now we would like to serialize only the ideas of the resource and you can see that it works perfectly

05:50.950 --> 05:53.400
we have only serialized that I.D..

05:55.530 --> 05:59.730
So let's also add content.

05:59.730 --> 06:03.440
This is also available under this content.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.000
Created art

06:10.250 --> 06:26.150
which is this created art and may be updated art which is this updated art now.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.640
Let's try this.

06:29.190 --> 06:35.070
Now you might have noticed something unexpected that now the dates are being serialized as an object

06:35.130 --> 06:38.430
because they are actually carbon objects.

06:38.430 --> 06:43.800
And this was automatically converted to string before but now it's not.

06:43.830 --> 06:49.590
So you are in full control here and you can decide how you can return your dates.

06:50.280 --> 06:58.530
So to just return this as string you can cast these attributes to a string using this simple type casting

06:58.530 --> 06:59.750
of BHP.

06:59.820 --> 07:04.110
So this will use the carbon date to string magic method

07:07.380 --> 07:10.110
and now you have it as you had before.

07:10.110 --> 07:14.590
So this is converted to a string OK.

07:14.620 --> 07:21.310
But here we are just realizing one eloquent model and this end point is about comments not a single

07:21.310 --> 07:21.850
comment.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.370
So how you can easily return a collection of elements.

07:26.470 --> 07:31.800
So there are some specific objects that you can create called Resource collections.

07:31.870 --> 07:39.780
But we have before we get to that it's also possible with just this simple comment resource class.

07:39.790 --> 07:48.270
So our resource class for a particular model and instead of creating a new instance of this model what

07:48.270 --> 08:00.270
you would do is you would call a static method called collection and it accepts our collection of something.

08:01.010 --> 08:01.670
In this case.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.420
This is not post comments first but post comments.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.480
So every element now let's save the changes.

08:09.470 --> 08:12.410
You can also comment out this line for clarity.

08:12.490 --> 08:21.660
And now let's see what do we have so we have our collection of all the comments for this blog post too

08:21.660 --> 08:28.920
wrapped inside the data with the attributes attributes that we want it and how we want it then we are

08:28.920 --> 08:35.700
in full control of course we do not have a user data we'll get to that in the next lecture.

08:36.060 --> 08:43.260
But now let's also see that it is actually possible to control how this element is being returned if

08:43.260 --> 08:45.510
you will go back to the comment resource.

08:45.690 --> 08:54.690
And for example you might want to return this US comment I.D. not just that I.D. as the attribute is

08:54.690 --> 09:03.500
called in that eloquent model you can do that now you can see there is a comment I.D. as the object

09:03.650 --> 09:07.400
element key not that I.D. us in that eloquent model.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.150
So this is how you can control that of course.

09:10.160 --> 09:16.670
Well you don't really need to do that but in case you would like to customize their property names of

09:16.670 --> 09:18.320
the adjacent objects.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.050
This is how you can do that.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.620
So you are in full control.

09:22.940 --> 09:30.020
So in the next lecture we will see how we can work with the relations of a particular resource and control

09:30.140 --> 09:32.150
what properties of our user.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.490
We would also like to serialize.
