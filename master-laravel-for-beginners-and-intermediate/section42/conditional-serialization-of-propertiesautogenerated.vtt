In the last lecture you have seen how you can conditionally show a relationship only when this relationship

00:07.230 --> 00:08.770
is being loaded.

00:08.790 --> 00:16.220
And now let's see how we can add some data to particular resource depending on some condition.

00:16.980 --> 00:24.060
So let's say that we have our API here which displays the information about the outer of the comment

00:24.690 --> 00:28.350
but it only displays that I.D. and a name.

00:28.350 --> 00:36.690
So if the user that is being called dedicated is an admin you might want to also display an email of

00:36.690 --> 00:39.080
this users through the API.

00:39.330 --> 00:46.380
So I cannot really show you that exact working example of that because we haven't worked on a real API

00:46.380 --> 00:55.090
yet nor we don't handle that out indication inside this API so notice that I'm only creating this end

00:55.090 --> 01:00.710
point inside a normal controller that is inside the web roots.

01:00.750 --> 01:08.070
So we'll handle creating our specific API endpoints later which will also include authentication but

01:08.070 --> 01:11.160
just so you can see right now how this works.

01:11.160 --> 01:21.090
Let's go to this comment user and include a field called email which should only be serialized if certain

01:21.090 --> 01:29.250
condition is true so we can achieve that using this when and the first parameter that you have to pass

01:29.340 --> 01:35.490
is a condition that will evaluate to abolish one which means true or false.

01:35.550 --> 01:43.650
So let's just put a true constant here because if you would like to check for user you would do of using

01:43.650 --> 01:47.850
the alpha seed which you would have to import here.

01:47.850 --> 01:57.200
So mind this import that was added of user which would give you the currently authenticated user which

01:57.200 --> 02:00.230
then has is admin attribute.

02:00.500 --> 02:09.050
And then the second field is either the value which you can do as this email or you can the closure

02:09.320 --> 02:12.290
here that will return something.

02:12.290 --> 02:19.580
So this actually won't work right now because we are not authenticated through this API because for

02:19.580 --> 02:25.440
every request we get a new cookie all of the lot of the session.

02:25.640 --> 02:31.720
So this will display error unfortunately because the user is not an object.

02:31.730 --> 02:34.220
So we are not how authenticated here.

02:34.280 --> 02:41.430
So let's do a simpler example right now and just make this a constant.

02:41.460 --> 02:46.790
So set true.

02:46.810 --> 02:52.040
So now you can see that every user now has an email included.

02:52.300 --> 02:58.130
And if you will set this to false that you may won't be included.

02:58.670 --> 03:08.120
So we'll handle creating API a proper way to be in accordance with how Lara is suggesting to do that

03:08.510 --> 03:10.360
in the next section.

03:10.370 --> 03:18.080
So just so you know this is how you can conditionally decide which attributes should be serialized or

03:18.080 --> 03:21.680
not depending on some additional factors.
