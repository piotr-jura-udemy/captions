00:01.010 --> 00:09.050
With what you know already, you should be more than ready to replace the damaged posts array with the

00:09.050 --> 00:15.410
real data from the database, lets you remove the posts filled first.

00:17.060 --> 00:21.590
The index action can now apply the blog post all.

00:25.830 --> 00:37.140
Make sure to import the model class, remember that the all method will return all table records from

00:37.140 --> 00:40.350
oldest to newest, first by default.

00:41.660 --> 00:50.270
Remember, if you need something different than defaults used to CareerBuilder, for example, the order

00:50.270 --> 00:53.180
by created out.

00:54.740 --> 00:57.170
Sorted in descending order.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.160
This would return blog posts from the newest first.

01:06.180 --> 01:11.400
You can also use query builder methods like the take method.

01:13.350 --> 01:21.780
To limit how many items you want to be returned, this would add a limit close to the executed rescuable.

01:22.260 --> 01:28.680
So you have to specify a number like five to only get five elements back from the query.

01:31.210 --> 01:39.520
Just remember that some metals exist in both the quarry builder, but also in the collection of models

01:39.520 --> 01:41.460
after the quarry is executed.

01:42.460 --> 01:52.390
Take is an example in the query builder, it would add a limit clause, but adding it after the get

01:52.390 --> 01:57.800
call that runs the query, it would operate on the ResultSet.

01:58.540 --> 02:02.650
This means you might accidentally run inefficient queries.

02:03.190 --> 02:08.710
Also, remember that the best way to learn is to try out queries by yourself.

02:08.980 --> 02:13.140
And for this, the best way is to run them in Tinker.

02:13.990 --> 02:18.610
Anyway, let's bring back this to be a simple old query.

02:19.750 --> 02:26.770
Now, to get one result, we can simplify our current show methods.

02:28.040 --> 02:38.720
To be a one liner, so we know this blog post find or fail method that would return four or four page

02:38.720 --> 02:40.990
if the model is not found in the database.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.340
So there is no need to use the abort if helper.

02:46.310 --> 02:47.480
Let's comment that out.

02:48.450 --> 02:55.980
And instead, in this place, let's do a blog post, find or fail, Heidi.

02:58.930 --> 02:59.680
Finally.

03:00.870 --> 03:03.060
Let's see if this actually works.

03:04.160 --> 03:12.050
So that's the page with posts currently we only have one inside the database, so we should be able

03:12.050 --> 03:15.760
to visit post with one and there it is.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.560
This is directly read from the database.
