Dean Kerr is a command line tool that lets you play around with parts of your Laravel up, it's useful

00:09.300 --> 00:15.270
to quickly check out how things work and will be handy to learn how mothers work.

00:15.630 --> 00:24.720
You started indeterminable bank in your project directory by running BHB Artisan Tinker.

00:27.190 --> 00:34.900
Let's see how to create and save a new model in Laravel by creating the new instance of the model,

00:35.290 --> 00:42.240
then feeling its properties, meaning its columns with data and then saving it using the safe method.

00:43.220 --> 00:55.040
So let's assign a new instance of the blog post class to a post variable, normally you'd have to specify

00:55.040 --> 00:58.190
the full class name, but Tinker is smart.

00:58.520 --> 01:05.870
It knows you meant a model from specific namespace, as Tinker is mostly used to try out things with

01:05.870 --> 01:06.890
the database.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.300
Now let's set the model title.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.590
And the model content.

01:23.750 --> 01:31.650
Typing the post variable will print them model properties, which, as you might remember, represent

01:31.850 --> 01:33.030
table columns.

01:33.860 --> 01:38.480
Finally, you can call the save method on the model.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.120
It should return.

01:41.120 --> 01:41.690
True.

01:41.990 --> 01:47.300
If you see any error, check if your database is running first.

01:49.180 --> 01:56.770
Now, you can check right now into database client that this record was actually saved.

01:59.580 --> 02:05.970
In my school workbench, you need to get the least of the tables and press this last button.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.460
And there it is, the.

02:11.140 --> 02:18.820
Interestingly, the idea was automatically assigned, but even more interesting is that the timestamps

02:18.820 --> 02:20.950
were also assigned.

02:23.260 --> 02:29.110
Now, let's wait a couple of seconds and change the title of the post.

02:37.570 --> 02:42.730
You have to call safe, so now we are actually modifying the existing model.

02:43.910 --> 02:54.650
And in the deep client, when you will run this again by pressing this funder, you can see that not

02:54.650 --> 03:03.080
only the title has changed, but also the timestamp updated art is different than created out.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.230
So it is being automatically updated by Laravel.

03:06.230 --> 03:14.000
Whenever you change the model, you can use these two columns to know when and the Laravel model was

03:14.000 --> 03:16.310
created and updated.
