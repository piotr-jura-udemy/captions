Let's begin by starting afresh fresh thinkers session.

00:05.280 --> 00:15.060
The simplest way to retrieve the single model is to use the model classes static, find the method that

00:15.060 --> 00:19.390
on the argument of this method is the idea of the model.

00:20.340 --> 00:28.740
Let's see that in Tinker, currently, we should only have one record for the blog post at least.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.450
So let's fetch it.

00:37.940 --> 00:38.570
There it is.

00:39.630 --> 00:47.160
Now you can do anything you need with this model, you can change Collum values, but if you do make

00:47.160 --> 00:55.000
sure you call the model save method afterwards, you can call models, delete method to remove it.

00:55.980 --> 01:02.850
Now, if you will specify that ID that does not exist, fine method returns null.

01:09.390 --> 01:17.430
It's useful to know us then, if you want to check if model with a given idea exists, you can compare

01:17.430 --> 01:20.520
the result of find to the null value.

01:21.550 --> 01:30.190
Often your code will depend on model existing, for example, the page for displaying the blog post

01:30.190 --> 01:34.660
assumes the post with the given I.D. does exist.

01:35.200 --> 01:43.840
Instead of checking the find method result for the null value and then returning an error, you can

01:43.840 --> 01:48.550
use the find or fail static method on the model.

01:48.910 --> 01:56.380
It would throw an exception resulting in for a four page being shown for the user if the model does

01:56.380 --> 01:57.100
not exist.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.050
So let's check it out.

02:02.490 --> 02:09.480
It, of course, works for the model that we have, but if I provide the wrong ID, there is the exception.
