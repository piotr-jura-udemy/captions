Let's begin this lecture by starting a fresh thinker session.

00:07.540 --> 00:14.290
To get all records from a table, you can use the old method of darts table model.

00:15.620 --> 00:26.240
Let's assign the result of blog post static all method Cole to the Post's variable all night, not like

00:26.240 --> 00:34.340
many other querying methods that can return more than one model to return of value, which is of the

00:34.340 --> 00:35.810
type collection.

00:37.970 --> 00:43.310
Collection class is a powerful lot of rubber on array type.

00:44.290 --> 00:51.370
Collections have a lot of handy methods that allow easy filtering, sorting and other array specific

00:51.370 --> 00:58.360
tasks, collections can be accessed like a using the square brackets syntax.

00:59.320 --> 01:09.940
They have methods like first to get the first element from the collection or count to count the elements,

01:09.940 --> 01:10.840
for example.

01:11.680 --> 01:19.650
Actually, there are so many possibilities, it would take a couple hours to go over each one of them.

01:20.350 --> 01:24.790
If you are keen to read about them now, go to this page.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.900
If you are keen to read about them now, go to this page.

01:31.910 --> 01:39.470
Collection class is widely used in lot of a legal system, not only in eloquent, you don't have to

01:39.470 --> 01:44.990
go and read this now, but eventually that's a really good idea to do it.

01:46.340 --> 01:59.000
Finally, it's possible to fetch couple models at once by their ID because you can pass an array to

01:59.000 --> 02:02.270
the find method specifying the IDs that you want.

02:03.440 --> 02:11.510
But in case of this method, it will only return the models which were found, so in our case, that

02:11.510 --> 02:14.690
would only be a collection with one model.
