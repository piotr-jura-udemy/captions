Let's take a closer look at models, we will use the blog post model we have already created as an example.

00:09.610 --> 00:15.550
First and foremost, every model is coupled with one database table.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.960
Every database table should have its own model of class.

00:21.640 --> 00:27.810
The model is a PE class that always extends the base model class.

00:28.630 --> 00:34.810
You should no doubt AP classes have static and instant's methods.

00:36.130 --> 00:46.270
Static methods belong to a class and instant's methods belong to a specific class instance, static

00:46.270 --> 00:56.440
methods in model are used to query the database, which returns model instances or to create new models,

00:57.010 --> 00:59.830
which also returns instances.

01:00.580 --> 01:07.590
You can say that model static methods represent the whole database table.

01:08.580 --> 01:16.860
Now, you can say the model instance matters represent an individual table role.

01:17.710 --> 01:27.610
So Save Method will create or update the table record, delete method will remove the table record.

01:28.870 --> 01:34.840
Model instance properties are directly marched to the database columns.

01:36.050 --> 01:45.890
As an example, take a look at the blog posts, stable, I'd title content are both the column names

01:46.430 --> 01:49.040
and the class instance properties.

01:49.700 --> 01:55.100
Model instance properties are used to read and modify the column values.

01:55.820 --> 02:03.440
You should also note that models have relationships to other models and also events.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.950
We will talk about that in details later.
