00:00.840 --> 00:08.590
Let's open the dot and file in the code editor as we are to configure the MySQL database connection.

00:09.300 --> 00:17.270
First, you need to connect to the database using some database client for a mug.

00:17.280 --> 00:25.350
I tend to recommend sequel or table plus four Windows and Linux, the MySQL workbench.

00:26.480 --> 00:34.250
My Uncle Workbench works for all systems, so I'll use it to show you how to create a new database.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.940
First, we need to configure the connection.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.170
Make sure your database is running first.

00:43.890 --> 00:50.670
Now Prest is adding a button and typed Conexion details the IP address, the port.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.210
Well, that probably should be left unchanged now.

00:54.210 --> 00:56.640
Username and password.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.020
In my case, this is a route for a user name and route for password.

01:02.850 --> 01:07.020
Now, you can give this connection some name like Laravel eight.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.390
And press, OK, now double click this and you should be connected to your database.

01:16.380 --> 01:26.490
Now, we actually should create the database, so for this, click the button for adding the new schema.

01:28.540 --> 01:31.990
Now, here you type the actual database name, you will create.

01:32.260 --> 01:36.930
I will use Lavallade, you are free to choose anything you prefer.

01:37.970 --> 01:46.310
Secondly, we need to choose the default colation, and it should be UTF.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.610
UTF eight, M.B four.

01:51.600 --> 01:59.970
It is how Laravel is configured by default, this setting lets you use full spectrum of Unicode characters

01:59.970 --> 02:02.460
in your database strings.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.220
Finally pressed the button.

02:07.270 --> 02:15.580
Apply again and close on the list of schemas masks, you should now see Laravel, eight.

02:16.820 --> 02:26.420
Press this info button and go to the tables tab and now head back to the editor, so we need to put

02:26.420 --> 02:29.750
the same connection details in the file.

02:29.930 --> 02:37.700
So host port database name that you just came up with and username and password.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.820
In my case, it's root for both.

02:44.460 --> 02:53.190
Final test to check if Laravel is configured properly with the database is to run P2P artisan migrate.

02:55.210 --> 03:00.040
Interminable, you should see more or less what I see on the screen.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.090
Don't worry about migration's just yet.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.980
I'll explain them in details very soon now.

03:07.120 --> 03:07.930
Head back to them.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.000
My school work workbench.

03:12.500 --> 03:21.490
And make sure that you are on this table, stop press refresh, and now you should see some tables are

03:21.490 --> 03:21.800
added.

03:21.950 --> 03:27.140
This means we are properly connected to the database from within Laravel.
