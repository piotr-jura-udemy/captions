00:00.800 --> 00:03.960
So we have just created our new Laravel project.

00:04.010 --> 00:12.080
Now let's open it in visual studio code using trick so you can type Code Dart, which will open visual

00:12.080 --> 00:15.510
studio code with all the contents of the current directory.

00:16.130 --> 00:19.160
So there it is, our Laravel project.

00:20.260 --> 00:27.130
I understand this might look a little bit intimidating for everyone that is new to Laravel, so let's

00:27.130 --> 00:33.280
quickly go over the folder structure and all the files out there, what they mean and what they are

00:33.280 --> 00:33.770
for.

00:34.720 --> 00:40.060
Let's go over the most important folders and files from top to bottom.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.550
So the first one is the ARB.

00:43.390 --> 00:51.100
It contains all the business logic of your application, whether it is handling a request or interacting

00:51.100 --> 00:52.210
with the database.

00:53.740 --> 01:00.400
Then there is the conflict, so as the name suggests here, you will configure your application.

01:01.700 --> 01:09.170
Then you have a database folder, which is for modifying and working with your database schema.

01:10.410 --> 01:17.970
A public folder contains some entry points to your application on Index B file, and additionally,

01:17.970 --> 01:22.830
May might contain some stylus scripts, images, things like this.

01:23.770 --> 01:32.420
Then resources, well, it also contains Stiles scripts, but also translations and some HTML.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.010
This is where you will be putting their views.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.780
That's why we have this MVC separation.

01:40.570 --> 01:44.320
So there is model models to leave in the app folder.

01:45.010 --> 01:51.430
Controller controllers leave in HTP controllers folder and views.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.170
Views are inside resources views Folarin.

01:56.710 --> 02:04.930
Then the Roots folder are also very important one here, you configure routes to your application routes

02:04.930 --> 02:07.900
are entry points to your app now.

02:08.230 --> 02:15.550
Also, there is a storage folder, tests and vendor, which basically contains all the third party libraries

02:15.550 --> 02:18.280
that you will install, including Laravel.

02:18.970 --> 02:26.500
Now, if you are already feeling dizzy from all this new words like comptrollers, roots models, don't

02:26.500 --> 02:26.760
worry.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.060
We will cover that later.

02:28.090 --> 02:31.830
Now, we are just having an overview of the project structure.

02:32.350 --> 02:36.190
So continuing we have adult and file.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.290
This is very important.

02:38.530 --> 02:42.970
It contains some environment specific settings for your app.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.440
Mostly this is credentials.

02:45.460 --> 02:51.850
So, for example, database credentials, they might be different in your local machine and when the

02:51.850 --> 02:53.040
app goes to server.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.510
So this is a very useful file.

02:56.110 --> 03:04.630
And then to manage any third party dependencies like third party libraries, you have composer Jason

03:04.630 --> 03:05.140
Faile.

03:05.350 --> 03:13.630
This is for PvP dependencies and package JSON, which is for JavaScript and an affront and dependencies.

03:14.710 --> 03:16.750
So basically, that's it.

03:17.320 --> 03:22.540
That's the most important folders and files in your Laravel project.
