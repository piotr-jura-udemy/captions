00:01.510 --> 00:07.240
There is one more file that we haven't covered in the last lecture, because I think it needs a separate

00:07.240 --> 00:10.640
lecture on its own Dods to artisan script.

00:11.260 --> 00:16.180
It is actually a script that will run your application on command line.

00:18.290 --> 00:26.980
Let's see what it can do, so bank in your project directory run by Artisan, and you would get a list

00:26.980 --> 00:28.330
of commands available.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.470
Those commands have different purposes.

00:31.990 --> 00:38.740
Some of them will run along with your application, for example, the ones from the Q category, they

00:38.740 --> 00:43.030
will run and processed all the background drops of your application.

00:43.810 --> 00:50.860
Other commands are informative, like at least will give you a list of all the registered routes in

00:50.860 --> 00:51.910
your application.

00:52.870 --> 01:00.730
Then there are commands which you can use to manage the database schema and a big group of commands

01:00.730 --> 01:02.950
that will let you scaffold called.

01:05.020 --> 01:09.590
Now, all those commands, they are actually written in P.

01:10.530 --> 01:16.920
Now, let me show you a documentation page from Laravel, which is about writing your own commands.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.760
It is actually very easy.

01:19.200 --> 01:25.260
You can first use Artisan to generate a scaffolding for a command, let's say send emails.

01:26.300 --> 01:33.380
And then you just implement such commands that can do some utility functions for your up, for example,

01:33.530 --> 01:38.210
in this case someone created a command up sense, some kind of emails.

01:41.500 --> 01:48.590
Now, there is also a different category of commands, for example, Tinker, that's one is very useful.

01:48.610 --> 01:53.000
So let's run it for a second puppy artisan Tinker.

01:54.250 --> 02:01.270
This will start a separate shell and will let you interact with your Laravel application through a command

02:01.270 --> 02:01.600
line.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.520
This is a great feature.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.440
Will use it a lot throughout this course.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.530
But for now, let's just kill it by pressing control.

02:09.550 --> 02:16.590
See, what we actually want to run is another command called Serve.

02:17.290 --> 02:24.310
This will start our development server with your project, so we would be able to visit it in the browser.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.860
Using puppy artisan's serve is the easiest way to develop a lot of application without setting up a

02:32.920 --> 02:36.850
complicated server like Apache or transgenics locally.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.400
Let's go ahead and run it.

02:39.610 --> 02:42.430
Be RDM serve.

02:42.970 --> 02:48.540
It should start a development server and your website should now be available at this address.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.930
Let's copy it and open it up in the browser.

02:54.370 --> 02:57.580
There it is, your newly created Laravel application.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.330
That's the main page of our up.

03:00.730 --> 03:08.500
Remember when you would like to stop this server, you just press control, see, and it will stop working.
