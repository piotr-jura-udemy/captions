In this section we'll learn how to implement a one to many polymorphic relationship.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.420
So we already know what a one to many relationship is.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.900
It is one model of one kind.

00:14.910 --> 00:20.880
In this example the blog post can be related to many models of different kind.

00:20.880 --> 00:28.470
In this example comments from the last section you should also understand what a polymorphic relationship

00:28.500 --> 00:29.570
is.

00:29.610 --> 00:37.950
It is a situation when model of one kind is not limited to be related to only another specific model

00:37.950 --> 00:38.860
of different kind.

00:38.860 --> 00:46.920
Like blog post in this situation the polymorphic relationship lets us associate comments to blog posts

00:47.130 --> 00:50.100
to users or basically any other model.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.530
You can also add this to images if you like.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.610
Now this is our current situation.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.820
We have BLOG POSTS table and comments table on the comments table.

00:59.820 --> 01:07.680
There is the blog post IDI field which basically late lets us relate comment only to the blog post and

01:07.680 --> 01:09.850
this is what we would like to achieve.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.840
So now the comments table will have two fields.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.250
Commendable ideas and commendable type.

01:18.060 --> 01:23.730
So as I've said in the last section this prefix commendable is up to you.

01:23.730 --> 01:29.860
You can come up with any name that you like but then there is a deal which basically holds the ideas

01:29.880 --> 01:38.100
of the related model either blog post I.D. or user I.D. and there is the column with the type suffix

01:38.220 --> 01:39.710
which holds the model name.

01:39.720 --> 01:46.110
So that could be a blog post user or image or any other model that you would like to create.

01:46.110 --> 01:50.530
This relation to so basically that's it.

01:50.540 --> 01:54.690
This is really a very simple concept so let's go ahead.

01:54.770 --> 01:59.260
Do not waste any more time and let's see how to create a migration for it.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.050
The relations and then implement this inside our application.
