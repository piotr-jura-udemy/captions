WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:05.360
In the last lecture I've said that we will be working with views in this one.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.170
So let's start with a forum responsible for adding a comment.

00:10.170 --> 00:16.800
So this is the underscore forum blade BHP from their resources views comments.

00:16.890 --> 00:24.470
It is a partial view that we are using inside the posts show blade BHP.

00:24.570 --> 00:27.330
We are basically including it here.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.380
And since we will require this to be used.

00:30.380 --> 00:35.220
Also on the user review we have to convert that to the component.

00:36.300 --> 00:43.290
So basically that's not the only reason we will convert that to the component because it also has to

00:43.290 --> 00:46.800
have a route to which those comments should be sent.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.420
Now it is hardcoded right now to send it to the post comments store.

00:52.650 --> 00:59.610
So it is only for blog posts so we'll have to pass this route somehow and the best way to do that is

00:59.610 --> 01:07.590
in my opinion to create a component and then pass the route to which the comments should be sent using

01:07.670 --> 01:10.200
our components slot.

01:10.590 --> 01:18.840
So let's go ahead and create a new file inside components folder for the views let's call it comment

01:18.990 --> 01:22.080
form blade BHP

01:25.420 --> 01:32.680
and let just copy everything from this original underscore form blade BHP.

01:32.980 --> 01:40.810
And here in this place where we specify the action attribute instead of generating our route we will

01:40.810 --> 01:46.030
just accept a slot which will have to pass to the component.

01:46.030 --> 01:47.640
Let's just call it the route.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.010
So this is required.

01:49.030 --> 01:51.250
It has to be passed now.

01:51.340 --> 01:53.470
Everything else stays the same.

01:53.530 --> 01:59.710
Unless you would also like to be able to modify the label or anything else inside that form.

01:59.710 --> 02:02.620
But we'll keep it simple.

02:02.620 --> 02:07.870
Now there is nothing else on the comments namespace so let's just delete that.

02:08.290 --> 02:13.550
Let's do not leave unnecessary code inside the application.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.390
Then let's open up service provider to register analyse for this component.

02:19.410 --> 02:32.930
So Blade component components comment form and the component would be called comment form

02:36.640 --> 02:44.990
so let's immediately modify the show blade BHP of the posts namespace instead of including this form

02:45.120 --> 02:49.720
and this forum which is a partial template we will add a component.

02:49.720 --> 02:55.270
So comment form and comment

02:58.030 --> 03:09.560
form and we have to pass a slot which is the root will generated the same way as we did in the original

03:09.590 --> 03:18.250
partial form so the roots should be pretty easy to remember because it is posts comments.

03:18.330 --> 03:28.180
Store and there is an attribute called Post which we can pass and generate using post I.D. So let's

03:28.180 --> 03:32.120
check if we have added everything yes.

03:32.150 --> 03:42.890
So this is everything that we need now will also add this form on the view of the user profile.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.240
So let's think where we can add up maybe just under the name

03:50.020 --> 03:51.810
and this time will do.

03:51.940 --> 03:58.750
Users comments store because this is how the root is named for adding comments to our user.

03:58.750 --> 04:06.190
Also the parameter is now user not opposed and since we have the user inside this template we can easily

04:06.190 --> 04:14.750
generate the user I.D. So let's so you can see how simple that is.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.460
Now let's go back to the show blade BHP for the blog post.

04:19.860 --> 04:25.740
What you also see here is this for ELTs directive where we display the comments.

04:25.740 --> 04:34.770
If there are any so we can also convert that to a component because there is no reason to put the exact

04:34.770 --> 04:41.760
same code into basically two templates unless you want them to look differently in some way.

04:41.850 --> 04:48.810
So if you do not and we'll do that we can just convert that to our component and then reuse that in

04:48.810 --> 04:52.860
the show blade BGP for posts and for the users.

04:52.860 --> 05:01.300
So let's go ahead and do that so we will have to create a new file inside components let's call it comment

05:01.300 --> 05:03.580
list blade BHP

05:06.600 --> 05:11.980
now we will just copy this fragment or we can even cut out immediately.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.380
Reformat that.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.370
Now let's see what we need here.

05:17.370 --> 05:21.270
Basically this is iterating over a list of comments.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.840
And it doesn't really have to read those comments from our post.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.840
We can just pass it as a slot.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.730
So if you create a variable inside the comment.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.650
This has to be passed as a slot when you use this component.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.060
Remember about that.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.210
You cannot just get the variable names out of the blue.

05:40.350 --> 05:46.770
So we are assuming that by using this variable which is defined nowhere inside the comment.

05:46.770 --> 05:53.670
This has to be passed to the comment when the cut to the component where the component is being used.

05:54.330 --> 05:59.680
Now you can see that we inside this very component use another component.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.900
So this is pretty nice.

06:02.970 --> 06:11.400
Now what we can also immediately modify here is we can pass the user I.D. So this will create a link

06:11.430 --> 06:15.590
to the user so let's do comment.

06:15.620 --> 06:21.970
User I.D..

06:22.200 --> 06:28.500
Now let's also go to the app service provider and add an alliance for this component so we can use it

06:28.590 --> 06:29.370
simpler.

06:29.370 --> 06:41.100
Now it is a comment list component name is comment uppercase least and let's use that first inside the

06:41.250 --> 06:46.690
show blade page before posts so comment list.

06:46.740 --> 06:54.330
Now we have to parse this slot so comments exact the same name of the slot as the variable that we have

06:54.330 --> 06:55.010
used here

06:59.020 --> 07:10.180
and here we should have access to that post variable comments attribute and just up and comment least

07:12.600 --> 07:15.180
now copy the same part of the code

07:18.630 --> 07:23.360
and paste up to the show blade BHP for the users.

07:23.550 --> 07:29.190
This time we fudged those comments not from post but user but not comments.

07:29.220 --> 07:38.620
Remember that this relationship is comments on so comments would be older comments written by a user

07:38.830 --> 07:48.030
but comments on our comments that are made on the user himself now save the changes.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.630
Now let's see if this still works.

07:50.630 --> 07:53.880
So first we'll check if we haven't broken anything.

07:53.930 --> 07:57.020
So make sure you are authenticated.

07:57.020 --> 08:03.680
Now let's go to the blog post page and we can immediately see the view is broken and we see this and

08:03.680 --> 08:12.710
comment form and comment list printed and this is because I've already used the upper case name for

08:12.710 --> 08:19.520
the comment form and this should be exactly as the comment component name itself.

08:19.520 --> 08:19.800
Sorry.

08:19.820 --> 08:20.990
I've said comment.

08:21.170 --> 08:21.920
Name.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.550
I meant component name.

08:24.590 --> 08:26.430
So this has to be lower case.

08:26.450 --> 08:32.810
So there is that and part and the exact thing as we used for the component name

08:36.290 --> 08:40.740
so here it also has to be and comment least.

08:41.090 --> 08:50.890
Let's also fixed up inside the post so lower case lower case save the changes now refresh

08:53.430 --> 08:56.430
so if you will now try to post the comment.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.440
Let's see if that still works.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.240
You can also check that the route should be properly set.

09:02.520 --> 09:10.260
So we have modified that inside the our component that now seems we are using the component instead

09:10.260 --> 09:11.420
of a partial form.

09:11.430 --> 09:14.130
We are passing our route slot to it.

09:14.130 --> 09:18.570
So let's see if the action is actually what it should be.

09:18.570 --> 09:20.690
So for posts it is laughable.

09:20.710 --> 09:30.100
The test lash posts post i d slash comments so it is proper make sure yours is also how it should be.

09:30.270 --> 09:38.810
Now at least five characters and let's press out comment but you can see nothing is there.

09:38.970 --> 09:45.960
So this means that the cash for the blog post is not properly reset and it should be

09:48.760 --> 09:49.000
so.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
This should happen here in the comment model creating event.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.340
Let's see what we are doing.

09:56.350 --> 10:02.740
So we are checking if the commendable type is of this class we are reading the constant class from the

10:02.740 --> 10:06.070
blog post model.

10:06.070 --> 10:09.400
So let's dump that information.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.060
So first we will dump the comment

10:15.270 --> 10:16.640
and then we use D.D..

10:16.680 --> 10:18.730
So dump and die.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.510
We'll actually see what this will print

10:24.300 --> 10:27.870
so apparently we are doing something wrong here.

10:27.930 --> 10:33.750
Now let's try to other comment again by the way I am just showing this to you so you know how we can

10:33.750 --> 10:40.260
debug any potential problems that you might be having when you create applications.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.680
Now what we see here is our new comment model.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.240
So let's see the attributes.

10:48.240 --> 10:55.890
Everything looks fine but let's not is what was added to the commendable type.

10:56.040 --> 11:07.250
So this is up slash blog post and what we have printed here as the up blog post class is actually up

11:07.340 --> 11:10.400
slash up blog post.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.660
So this is incorrect.

11:11.660 --> 11:19.010
What we should have done is we do not need this up prefix because blog post is from the name same namespace

11:19.040 --> 11:23.510
us comment and this classes which are on the same level under namespace.

11:23.510 --> 11:31.700
You do not have to import so I didn't have to add this up prefix before the blog post.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.220
So let's refresh that to see if this is correct now.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.230
Yes it is.

11:36.230 --> 11:43.900
So I can now remove this code and also fix this in this place.

11:44.020 --> 11:51.880
And now this should be reset the cash for the blog posts should be reset and we should see that this

11:52.300 --> 11:53.610
comment was added.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.510
Now you can see how I've tried a couple of times.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.350
So now we see all the comments.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.810
Let's see that again.

12:01.880 --> 12:06.450
This should be working now.

12:07.490 --> 12:09.630
OK let's are the comment.

12:09.950 --> 12:18.910
We can immediately see this new comment and let's now go to the user profile using any of those links.

12:18.910 --> 12:26.110
So for example John Doe so something is also incorrect on the profile page.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.000
So let's see what might be wrong.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.840
So I've put all those components in the wrong place.

12:34.850 --> 12:42.950
They should actually be inside this div which has the class column 8 because otherwise everything is

12:42.950 --> 12:43.780
just broken.

12:43.790 --> 12:48.880
This is just the right side of this one four to four split.

12:48.980 --> 12:52.110
So this is how it should be.

12:52.190 --> 12:53.340
Now it looks correct.

12:53.540 --> 12:59.370
Well more or less because basically we see this comment form you can restart it if you wish differently.

12:59.600 --> 13:07.240
But now let's verify if the link is proper inside the form so the forum method is post.

13:07.250 --> 13:18.650
Action is lot of older test users slash one which happens to be the same as the profile I.D. slash comments.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.820
Well let's see if this works so we will say something.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.740
I like your articles.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.240
John

13:28.970 --> 13:30.620
out comment.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.920
We see our flash message.

13:34.300 --> 13:44.020
And the comment was added to the John Doe so if you will find any of the blog posts by John Doe it's

13:44.020 --> 13:47.630
hard to find now so let's just find him somewhere.

13:53.680 --> 13:59.830
You can visit his profile and then U.S. comments that were added to the John Doe profile so mine.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.370
This is not comments added by John Doe.

14:02.410 --> 14:06.660
You can also for example display them here like any of the user activity.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.780
Instead of just an avatar and user name.

14:09.790 --> 14:14.890
But obviously that's not our focus to make this up beautiful and usable.

14:14.890 --> 14:20.920
We are just trying to learn as much as possible on lava as quickly as possible.
