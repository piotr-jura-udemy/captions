Now last time we created this simple batch component that we are using when we display our blog post

00:08.950 --> 00:16.300
and you might have noticed that we have added it to our global namespace for our larval blade of use.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.720
And that's not a best practice to do that.

00:19.720 --> 00:29.410
And instead you should actually create a new folder called it components and move this component.

00:29.410 --> 00:32.110
This batch component into this folder.

00:32.410 --> 00:37.180
But now if you will refresh the page you will see that it no longer works.

00:37.180 --> 00:40.180
It says that the batch of you wasn't found.

00:40.180 --> 00:47.950
And that's because when you create a component and it is not in their main folder of your views you

00:47.950 --> 00:51.220
will have to specify the actual folder name.

00:51.220 --> 00:54.260
So components that batch.

00:56.890 --> 01:04.720
Now it is being displayed but it might not be very convenient to type all this complicated directory

01:04.720 --> 01:06.640
names for your components.

01:06.640 --> 01:13.210
You would like to actually keep it simple because otherwise this is becoming so verbose that you might

01:13.210 --> 01:18.210
think that creating and using components doesn't really make sense for you.

01:18.220 --> 01:21.760
You are typing more than you did before.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.970
So obviously the result solution for this.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.110
So let's close all these templates and open our up service provider.

01:33.210 --> 01:41.250
Now this is the place where we where you can register a thing called component alliance and you can

01:41.250 --> 01:44.560
do that simply by using the blade for site.

01:44.580 --> 01:53.480
So at this time you might want to press enter to add the import for the blade for Sayed and call the

01:53.480 --> 01:55.900
component static method.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.560
Now specify the name of your template.

01:59.740 --> 02:03.070
So that fully qualified name components blade

02:06.150 --> 02:12.660
and we will add alliance for this component call it batch.

02:12.720 --> 02:21.720
Now this simple piece of code is doing us a great favor because now instead of using the component directive

02:21.780 --> 02:28.790
we can magically add budge directive and finish it with end batch.

02:29.870 --> 02:37.730
So now you do not really have to specify the component name because obviously it actually knows what

02:37.730 --> 02:43.770
is the component name you only can specify the additional parameters as the first argument.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.670
So let's save the changes and see if that works.

02:46.670 --> 02:49.420
You can see that it works perfectly obviously.

02:49.500 --> 02:57.530
You can also remove any additional slot settings like we are modifying the type here to display batch

02:57.560 --> 03:00.950
with a different color if you will remove that

03:03.990 --> 03:08.700
it still works and it is green by default because that's how we design it.

03:09.210 --> 03:15.180
So remember when you create your components it's a good practice to put them into the components folder

03:16.350 --> 03:19.360
and then inside your app service provider.

03:19.410 --> 03:26.390
Use the blade if I say component method specified a full complete full component template name.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.450
And then second parameter would be Elias.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.880
So you can use it as a blade directive.
