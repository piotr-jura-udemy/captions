00:00.510 --> 00:07.740
Now as promised in the last lecture now we'll create our card component which will contain an arbitrary

00:07.740 --> 00:09.670
list of elements.

00:09.690 --> 00:15.950
So this might be links but also can be text inside the list like we have here.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.920
Like who is the most active creator.

00:19.920 --> 00:27.370
So let's go ahead and add this new component inside components FOLDER WE'LL CALL IT cards.

00:27.390 --> 00:38.120
So let's create cart blade BHP and immediately let's create an alliance for our new component so this

00:38.120 --> 00:39.730
would be components.

00:39.750 --> 00:46.870
Cart and the layoffs would be cart OK.

00:46.880 --> 00:56.600
So we have those cards inside the index blade BHP which can be found on the review's posts and you can

00:56.600 --> 01:01.880
see that we have those big blocks of code that we display.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.800
Basically it's the same code.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.280
So we have free cards.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.130
But the problem is that we display the items differently.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.540
So for this particular one we display links.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.600
And here we just display our text.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.490
So let's see how we can achieve that.

01:19.490 --> 01:29.690
So for simplicity let's copy a single card inside the card template and reformat it a little bit.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.010
Now let's go ahead and create some slots.

01:34.010 --> 01:39.060
So the first slot would be definitely the title.

01:39.070 --> 01:42.440
That's the simple one.

01:42.470 --> 01:49.420
Next we would like subtitle so mind that we are making those slots mandatory.

01:49.420 --> 01:52.010
So they have to be provided.

01:52.430 --> 02:01.280
Now for this third slot instead of most commented posts or whatever we can pass here will use another

02:01.280 --> 02:05.400
slot called items.

02:05.870 --> 02:15.460
So we'll iterate over a list of the items and then we'll display something inside the least but will

02:15.460 --> 02:21.010
only echo and will only echo that item.

02:21.010 --> 02:25.180
So this is our new card component.

02:25.180 --> 02:32.620
Now let's implement it for the simple case which is our card with the names.

02:33.280 --> 02:38.040
So we'll on a card this time it will have some additional arguments.

02:38.050 --> 02:43.090
So we start with an array and and card.

02:43.570 --> 02:50.410
So the title for this particular card component is most active

02:54.460 --> 02:57.910
so let's do most active and subtitle

03:00.710 --> 03:08.240
is users with most posts written.

03:08.340 --> 03:17.280
Now if we would like to pass the items then well it might be a little bit complicated to pass those

03:17.400 --> 03:19.860
items in this array.

03:19.860 --> 03:24.770
Well basically it's not complicated to code but it it will be unreadable.

03:24.810 --> 03:32.850
So how you can additionally pass the data for the slots is using the slot directive where you specify

03:32.910 --> 03:35.330
the name of the slot.

03:35.420 --> 03:43.320
This is items and then you can pass something some additional data.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.680
Well so what can we do.

03:46.680 --> 03:55.260
We have this most active and we want to pass an array of names of those users.

03:55.260 --> 04:00.150
So it might seem a little bit complicated how we can do that but actually it would be very simple.

04:00.150 --> 04:06.600
So what we will do is we'll create a collection using collect helper function.

04:06.600 --> 04:16.010
This will create a new lot of our collection from the most active users and now we'll use our collection

04:16.010 --> 04:22.460
method which I've shown you when we use lateral thinker pluck which will only pick one property from

04:22.460 --> 04:26.200
this which is a name.

04:26.450 --> 04:32.930
Now also you do not really have to pass those parameters here inside the array.

04:32.930 --> 04:41.200
They can be also passed from within the component using slot so you can pass.

04:41.810 --> 04:42.770
Subtitle

04:49.070 --> 04:56.030
like that and instead of passing this subtitle Inside an array you can do it like that.

04:58.270 --> 05:00.080
So this might be more readable.

05:00.100 --> 05:07.060
That also depends of how long arguments you are trying to pass or how long are the is the data you are

05:07.060 --> 05:10.690
trying to pass to your components.

05:10.690 --> 05:19.540
So let's comment out this card so we can see if our component actually works properly so it should display

05:19.600 --> 05:29.050
the same thing as we see here so after refreshing you see that we still have the most active users.

05:29.110 --> 05:32.650
And the subtitle is users with most polls written

05:35.440 --> 05:41.250
if will change it to writers we can see that this works perfectly.

05:41.830 --> 05:46.080
So now we can safely remove this part.

05:46.310 --> 05:54.230
Now you can see that it is becoming much clearer and since this is essentially the same thing most active

05:54.260 --> 06:00.170
last month we can immediately copy this card paste it here

06:03.050 --> 06:07.030
and just change the data that we pass through the slot.

06:07.040 --> 06:14.500
So most active last month is the title here is the subtitle.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.950
So let's pass it here so it is readable

06:19.620 --> 06:23.100
and now these items would be most active.

06:23.100 --> 06:23.940
Last month

06:27.540 --> 06:37.730
Now let's remove this div element and what we ended up is basically our reused component so let's see

06:37.730 --> 06:39.770
if that's still works after refreshing.

06:39.770 --> 06:44.870
You can see this is basically exactly the same.

06:44.870 --> 06:49.550
So now let's go to our most comments.

06:49.580 --> 06:53.080
So this is quite a different example.

06:54.380 --> 07:03.980
So let's first paste our card element or card component and this time we'll have to modify our component

07:04.040 --> 07:05.820
a little bit.

07:05.990 --> 07:13.110
So by default we think that items should be a collection so we iterate over it using for each.

07:13.130 --> 07:21.500
And then we render the list items so we can also do it differently.

07:21.500 --> 07:28.910
Now we will always display a list inside this component but we can add an if statement and we can check

07:28.910 --> 07:34.370
what's the type of the items object using p p is a function.

07:35.090 --> 07:44.120
So items or any other slot would always be a kind of larval object and we can verify if this is a collection.

07:44.120 --> 07:50.050
So if it is Illuminate Support collection

07:54.400 --> 07:57.450
then we'll iterate over all the elements.

07:57.460 --> 08:03.810
But additionally when it is not we'll just render it as it is.

08:03.810 --> 08:09.180
So whatever was passed through items will be just rendered.

08:09.190 --> 08:13.710
So we are doing it for another case when this actually won't be a collection.

08:13.720 --> 08:21.100
But actually it would be an HDMI L that you would like to render directly by doing something else than

08:21.100 --> 08:24.640
just echoing items.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.760
Now let's go back to our index.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.580
So here we have the slope items

08:35.130 --> 08:45.830
will up and slot here and modify our title to be most commented the soup title.

08:45.830 --> 08:48.290
What people are currently talking about

08:53.460 --> 09:07.020
and now we'll get this for each loop and we'll put that directly asked the items slot.

09:07.210 --> 09:14.620
So what we will do here is since we are passing on HDMI because this will render an HDMI instead of

09:14.620 --> 09:23.370
passing our collection object as we did here so we can already remove this code.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.990
Now let's see if this will work.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.360
So after refreshing you can see that we actually are.

09:31.380 --> 09:39.450
Well this actually still works and what we did here is well if it is a collection of items then just

09:39.960 --> 09:47.700
look through them and display them as our normal text but if you want something more customized like

09:47.700 --> 09:54.960
in this case we just don't display our list element but we display a link and we need a post I.D. to

09:54.960 --> 10:00.390
generate a root and a post title so it gets much more complicated.

10:00.420 --> 10:08.510
This is how can you render it conditionally but still reuse the same simple card component.
