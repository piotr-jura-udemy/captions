Now I'm adding a short errata to the course as I've shown you on the lecture about creating a local

00:09.480 --> 00:17.550
queries scopes that you might use having Clowes to filter by the blog post count alliance which would

00:17.550 --> 00:23.070
be the count which would be an alliance created from a sub query that will be added here because we

00:23.070 --> 00:24.620
use with cards.

00:24.630 --> 00:31.530
So basically this would add a sub query which would filter those blog posts in this relation.

00:31.530 --> 00:37.920
So the problem is that when we run unit tests you can't see it here but the Eskew a light is complaining

00:37.920 --> 00:44.670
that you can't use are having close without a group by which actually is a valid thing to do.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.640
Inside the Eskew standard.

00:46.650 --> 00:50.640
So my sequel well doesn't complain about that.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.260
It's happy that you use that.

00:52.380 --> 00:58.770
There is no problem with it but Eskew a light doesn't like that and the problem is that we are basically

00:58.770 --> 01:06.160
not using aggregate as an result which we are selecting but we are creating an alliance.

01:06.600 --> 01:14.520
So the proper way to do it for both my Eskew L and Eskew a light in Lavell is to actually use R has

01:14.520 --> 01:25.010
method to filter the existence of a specific amount of results from the relation which we have here.

01:25.020 --> 01:32.820
So the blog posts and instead of using the alliance name which is blog posts count we should use the

01:32.940 --> 01:37.860
relation name blog posts and everything else stays the same.

01:37.860 --> 01:47.250
Now if you will run the tests they are passing but also it works on the page so it works for the both

01:47.250 --> 01:48.380
databases.

01:48.420 --> 01:55.330
So sorry for that I am adding a late just because I want you to have a clean truck inside the Get Up.

01:55.590 --> 01:59.140
What has changed and when and also I've added.

01:59.700 --> 02:06.300
Well in the lecture when we do that there is also information that this would be fixed in this very

02:06.300 --> 02:06.990
lecture.
