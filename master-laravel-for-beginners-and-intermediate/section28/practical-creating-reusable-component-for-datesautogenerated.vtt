00:00.600 --> 00:05.370
Let's find another example where we reuse the same markup.

00:05.460 --> 00:10.820
So the good example would be to show when the post was added and by whom.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.250
Because we also use that inside the Post's view.

00:14.250 --> 00:21.750
So let's find one post which has comments like this one there is the same text here without an out or

00:21.750 --> 00:23.060
so we can add it.

00:23.130 --> 00:29.340
And also since we do not have our users assigned to the comments yet and well we do not have the form

00:29.340 --> 00:31.800
for adding comments at all.

00:31.800 --> 00:38.270
We also display when this was added but we doubt an outer.

00:38.280 --> 00:46.050
We also know that we have timestamps so well we can also display when the comment was actually updated

00:47.490 --> 00:52.700
so we can create a reusable component for this purpose.

00:52.890 --> 01:02.310
So let's create a brand new file and we can call it something like updated blade BHP

01:05.200 --> 01:11.170
and now let's head to the index template which we have created for displaying all the blog posts.

01:11.200 --> 01:18.550
And initially we'll copy this code chunk which displays when the blog post was added using this for

01:18.550 --> 01:27.930
humans and the name of the outer so moved that into this updated template.

01:27.970 --> 01:40.940
Save the changes for now and are the new component alliance so blade component components updated and

01:40.950 --> 01:46.460
let's call it update it doesn't really matter how you call it you can use whatever alliance you want.

01:46.480 --> 01:53.720
So it doesn't have to be the same as the component last part of the component name.

01:53.790 --> 01:54.120
All right.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.040
So we have our component defined.

01:57.240 --> 02:07.230
Now we have to create some slots inside it so we'll definitely need a date because all of those use

02:07.230 --> 02:08.910
cases have a date.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.150
So this won't be a default slot.

02:12.150 --> 02:15.670
This would be our date.

02:16.200 --> 02:23.210
Now we might want to use this component differently so it might be that we want to show the text under

02:23.210 --> 02:26.910
it but we might also use updated.

02:26.910 --> 02:29.400
So let's add a condition here.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.510
So if

02:33.800 --> 02:38.840
well we'll do it differently so we'll display slot if it is defined.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.660
So the default value that you will pass to a component

02:44.400 --> 02:51.090
if it's not passed will just display added by default with our space.

02:51.090 --> 02:53.610
So it would be readable.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.160
And then we'll add a condition

02:59.530 --> 03:07.650
so if the name was specified we'll display the name here.

03:08.790 --> 03:13.130
So that's another slot.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.810
Now let's take a look at this component.

03:14.820 --> 03:21.540
So the default value the default slot if it won't be provided will just use at it but it might be something

03:21.540 --> 03:24.780
else like updated or deleted or whatever.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.220
Now we'll add another slot date.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.950
So this is mandatory and then an optional slot called name.

03:32.130 --> 03:42.600
So if it is provided will displayed and it all will be inside a paragraph with a text muted.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.920
Now let's go to our index and use this component.

03:46.930 --> 03:57.940
So we do updated and updated now we won't pass any default slot here so we can ignore that.

03:57.970 --> 04:08.460
But we will have some additional parameters that would be a date and a date would be post created art.

04:09.640 --> 04:17.170
And actually what we can do is since we always want to display are difference for few months we'll just

04:17.170 --> 04:18.850
move it to the template.

04:18.850 --> 04:25.450
So instead of just echoing the date and calling this diff for humans everywhere we'll call it inside

04:25.450 --> 04:30.570
the component.

04:30.580 --> 04:35.290
So now what we can do is we can just pass the date US post created ARGs

04:38.140 --> 04:48.920
and then additional parameter name would be post user name.

04:48.930 --> 04:55.890
Now we can remove that part or at least comment it out and say let's see if that still works.

04:55.890 --> 05:02.410
Now you can see that even if we have we haven't provided our default value for the slot it actually

05:02.430 --> 05:04.950
does not display the text that we wanted.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.660
So this one other one.

05:06.870 --> 05:14.790
Well it is actually because whatever you have between updated and and updated is being passed to the

05:14.790 --> 05:18.290
component as the default slot variable.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.290
So this in this case is an empty text.

05:21.290 --> 05:26.820
So this condition will never work because it is actually a defined variable.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.370
It's not normal.

05:28.380 --> 05:32.850
So what we should do instead is we should check if it's empty.

05:32.850 --> 05:35.100
And also three meet.

05:35.190 --> 05:45.020
So if the dream slot is empty then we'll display other otherwise we'll display the slot

05:47.690 --> 05:50.030
so save the changes and refresh it.

05:50.030 --> 05:52.080
Now it works as expected.

05:52.100 --> 06:01.760
So let's reuse this component in the other places so we can now remove this part.

06:01.910 --> 06:10.490
Well we can even shrink this component to be more to be shorter basically.

06:10.490 --> 06:16.880
Now let's go back to our individual blog post and let's see where we can reuse that.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.850
So we have it here.

06:21.110 --> 06:29.180
What we have here a post created up and we haven't displayed name before but now we will because we

06:29.180 --> 06:36.780
actually have a post which has a user so we can read the user name save the changes.

06:36.780 --> 06:43.260
Now let's go to a blog post maybe let's find some that actually has a comment.

06:44.310 --> 06:44.620
OK.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.890
We have it where.

06:46.200 --> 06:52.620
When it was uttered and by whom it was added and we use the same markup as we did on the index page

06:52.650 --> 06:55.110
which displays all the blog posts.

06:55.110 --> 07:01.970
And finally we can even use that for comments but this time we only have a date.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.310
We do not have a name.

07:03.420 --> 07:13.030
So we just want to provide name only the date but actually it has to be a comment created that.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.730
Now let's see.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.990
And you can see that we have used this same code.

07:20.040 --> 07:32.420
Now if you would also like to display when the blog post was updated you can use updated art.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.900
And while this time we won't use the name because we actually do not keep who updated the post only

07:38.930 --> 07:47.060
when it was updated so we can display it here save the changes refresh.

07:47.060 --> 07:56.660
And this time we actually have to specify the text so it was updated.

07:56.720 --> 08:03.620
Now you can see that this was added three weeks ago and updated 20 hours ago.

08:03.620 --> 08:08.420
So we reuse the component at least four times right now.

08:08.480 --> 08:16.130
Now in the next lecture will finally get to our cards on the right and we'll use a little bit more complicated

08:16.130 --> 08:18.800
examples of larval blade components.
