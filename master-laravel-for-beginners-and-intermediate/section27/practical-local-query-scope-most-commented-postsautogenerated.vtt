00:00.540 --> 00:07.980
Now last time I told you that the best way to learn about use the query scope is to have some practice.

00:08.010 --> 00:11.070
So I will give you this practice right now.

00:11.070 --> 00:16.830
So in the next couple of lectures we'll try to do something cool with our application.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.330
So as the first example what we'll do is instead of just displaying this boring list of all the blog

00:24.330 --> 00:32.850
posts on our application we'll try to display another box which would show what blog posts are the most

00:32.850 --> 00:35.230
commented ones.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.990
So let's see how we can do that.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.610
Let's go to the blog post.

00:39.450 --> 00:44.690
So this is our first local scope and we'll add next.

00:44.760 --> 00:50.230
So we are having public function starting with the scope as always.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.990
And let's call this scope.

00:51.990 --> 00:54.640
Most commented.

00:55.110 --> 01:00.230
Now we have one argument which is the query builder.

01:01.040 --> 01:01.520
All right.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.660
Now let's see how we can get that.

01:03.660 --> 01:14.610
So you know that we can use the wave count method to fetch the count of particular relation us additional

01:14.610 --> 01:21.450
field that is being selected from the query so we can do with count comments.

01:21.450 --> 01:29.760
And I'm not sure if you remember that or not but using whip count with our relation name will produce

01:29.850 --> 01:34.760
a field called comments count.

01:34.750 --> 01:41.220
Now what we can do with this is now since it is being selected we can order by it.

01:41.850 --> 01:50.850
So let's add order by comments count and we'll do that in descending order.

01:50.850 --> 01:58.410
So we want to show first all the blog posts that have at most comments added to them.

01:59.210 --> 01:59.570
OK.

01:59.580 --> 02:09.460
Now let's say the changes and let's open the terminal and run the artisan Tinker So BHP artisan thinker

02:09.700 --> 02:13.250
this way will verify if that actually works.

02:13.270 --> 02:24.110
So we are using a blog post we can call most commented.

02:24.200 --> 02:30.830
Now we'll just get the actual query and to make results actually readable on the screen.

02:30.830 --> 02:37.670
We'll use the method of the collections that we have used before which is called pluck which means we

02:37.670 --> 02:42.860
would like to only take a couple of properties or actually we want just one.

02:42.860 --> 02:53.380
So we want the comments count and what we did is we made sure that we got results ordered by the comments

02:53.380 --> 02:53.800
count.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.490
So the most commented blog post has 12 comments.

02:57.490 --> 03:00.300
Second one is also with 12.

03:00.370 --> 03:04.650
And then you see less and less now.

03:04.970 --> 03:05.280
OK.

03:05.290 --> 03:10.170
This works we are sure that our query scope is working properly.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.210
Now let's actually implement that.

03:12.210 --> 03:15.850
So it is visible inside the application.

03:16.180 --> 03:22.530
So let's proceed with implementing this inside the view where we display all the blog posts.

03:22.540 --> 03:28.480
So you will have to open a view from the views posts indexed BHP.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.570
So here is a list of all our blog posts.

03:32.920 --> 03:42.250
And as you can see it is being rendered inside the layout inside a div class container.

03:42.250 --> 03:49.160
So what we can do for that is we can use the grid system from bootstrap.

03:49.300 --> 03:58.180
So we'll have to add our role and some columns into it so let's go ahead and do that.

03:58.190 --> 04:10.410
So inside that section content will add div class with the CSX class row.

04:10.570 --> 04:17.720
We'll have to close it at the end.

04:17.740 --> 04:23.370
Now what we display here in the four ls directive block inside it.

04:23.470 --> 04:30.670
So all the blog posts will have a column with with eight

04:36.790 --> 04:38.510
so this would be the bigger one.

04:39.220 --> 04:46.880
And will also display our special box with that column with four.

04:46.890 --> 04:50.760
So this would be like two thirds one third split

04:54.190 --> 05:03.160
here will display some extra box that will show the most commented blog posts at the current time.

05:03.160 --> 05:09.990
So for that we'll use our card element from the bootstrap so let's copy this quite big.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.290
Example we'll have something like this.

05:13.540 --> 05:18.280
So copy this and paste into here.

05:18.280 --> 05:25.930
Now it's not really properly formatted so we'll have to do some work to make it look a little bit better.

05:25.930 --> 05:26.230
Okay.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.050
So let me format that really quickly.

05:29.410 --> 05:29.700
Okay.

05:29.710 --> 05:33.900
We won't need an image and now we can change the title.

05:33.910 --> 05:49.650
So most comment that and the subtitle to something what people are currently talking about now we will

05:49.650 --> 05:53.760
also we won't need those links at the bottom.

05:53.760 --> 06:02.670
But here is a list of all the blog posts that are supposed to be the most commented at the current time.

06:02.730 --> 06:10.320
Now inside this view we have access to the posts the variable that we have passed here.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.450
Now we will have to pass another one

06:16.340 --> 06:17.490
so let's call it.

06:17.490 --> 06:25.040
Most Commented and we will fetch that using blog post most comment at

06:28.170 --> 06:31.920
and um maybe we won't need too much.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.670
So let's use take five and get

06:39.480 --> 06:39.800
now.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.310
Let's see if all of that works.

06:43.670 --> 06:53.310
So yes it is being displayed here properly sized US one third two thirds split.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.600
Now let's go back to the index template.

06:59.980 --> 07:03.730
And here we can use that for each directive

07:07.470 --> 07:16.290
so well maybe well it's actually renamed up to better names so most comment that we've this type of

07:16.290 --> 07:26.670
case almost most comment that US post let's close the for each using end for each.

07:26.920 --> 07:34.070
And obviously we will only have to display one element inside of this loop.

07:34.780 --> 07:39.830
So let's echo the post title.

07:39.990 --> 07:40.540
All right.

07:40.660 --> 07:47.300
Now let's see what people are currently talking about.

07:47.310 --> 07:49.590
And we have five posts.

07:49.590 --> 07:55.020
So apparently this one is the one that people talk about most often.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.000
So let's find it.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.120
And while this makes sense it actually has 12 comments.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.960
So with him it seems that it is actually working properly.

08:05.190 --> 08:08.940
Now let's also go ahead and style it a little bit better

08:12.270 --> 08:23.650
so we'll change this paragraph to age 6 header and let's also modify the classes to use card subtitle

08:25.290 --> 08:37.030
and some marking at the bottom end of text muted and maybe also will reformat that so it is clearly

08:37.030 --> 08:39.010
visible on the screen.

08:39.280 --> 08:47.680
And what we can also additionally do here is we can create a link to those particular most commented

08:47.740 --> 08:49.660
blog posts.

08:49.660 --> 08:55.070
So it is root posts show.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.920
Now we'll have to specify that I.D. us post Heidi

09:08.180 --> 09:10.530
inside it would be the post title.

09:10.970 --> 09:14.670
And let's close the core element.

09:14.750 --> 09:19.010
So let me check if I did that properly.

09:19.190 --> 09:22.850
The parameter name is actually are post not I.D..

09:22.850 --> 09:23.240
All right.

09:23.270 --> 09:27.800
Now let's save the changes and verify if this actually works.

09:27.800 --> 09:36.780
So let's refresh this page so we have this most commented books what people are currently talking about.

09:37.020 --> 09:40.620
And we have the links to the most popular our blog posts.

09:40.620 --> 09:45.220
You can see that they all have a lot of comments.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.970
So that was the one example.

09:47.970 --> 09:54.930
And in the next lecture we'll see some more interesting examples that you can use for our application.
