00:00.830 --> 00:08.210
To be able to visit your project on your local computer under a custom domain like Laravel DOT Test,

00:08.210 --> 00:13.670
for example, you need to configure a so-called virtual Hulst in the Apache Web server.

00:14.450 --> 00:18.090
Just so you know, doing this is completely optional.

00:18.830 --> 00:27.260
There is a much easier way to run your Laravel app using the built in development web server 99 percent

00:27.260 --> 00:31.610
of the time it's enough to use a built in server for local development.

00:32.330 --> 00:41.890
The development server is started by running BB Artisan Service Command in the project directory and

00:41.930 --> 00:44.120
can be stopped by pressing control.

00:44.120 --> 00:44.630
See?

00:48.280 --> 00:54.130
The project is available under the localhost IP with the Port 80000 by default.

00:56.250 --> 01:04.500
This and the next lecture is here only for legacy reasons, but if you decided to go along, the process

01:04.500 --> 01:05.640
is not complicated.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.280
Go to the exam folder.

01:10.550 --> 01:22.310
Then to Apache config folder and open the HTP decon file, mind that the extension of this file can

01:22.310 --> 01:23.810
be hidden on your system.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.390
Well, it depends on your system settings.

01:27.450 --> 01:34.920
That's the only file you will see there called HD DVD anyway, you can drag it onto the visual studio

01:34.920 --> 01:35.460
called.

01:37.450 --> 01:42.970
Next, press control F and search for the hosts.

01:44.990 --> 01:48.680
It should take you around line five to one.

01:49.900 --> 01:55.810
And commence this line if it is commanded by removing the harsh character from the beginning of the

01:55.810 --> 02:00.770
line, if it is already uncommented, then leave it as it is.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.730
This makes Apache use their separate file that contains the virtual host config.

02:07.450 --> 02:10.020
Now we need to open this viscose file.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.330
So go to the extra folder.

02:14.740 --> 02:22.720
And locate the htp d v Holst's dot com and then drag it to the ED.

02:24.030 --> 02:28.770
Again, the extension might be hidden here, but the name is unique.

02:32.490 --> 02:41.070
There are two example configurations in there, and we will modify one toggled they command in the first

02:41.070 --> 02:42.840
one by selecting it.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.120
And pressing control on your keyboard, you might have to do that twice.

02:54.170 --> 03:00.620
Remove the first line and set the document routes to points to the Laravel application where you have

03:00.620 --> 03:01.370
created it.

03:02.440 --> 03:10.510
By default, this would be Seekamp H.T. Dogs, Laravel, and then we need to actually point to the public

03:10.510 --> 03:19.150
folder inside our Laravel application, the server name has to be Laravel to test and we can specify

03:19.150 --> 03:23.560
that allow us to be Laravel the test with the prefix.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.510
W w w.

03:28.380 --> 03:35.550
Additionally, configurator files were errors and server access log would be logged into in case of

03:35.550 --> 03:38.160
a party error specific to this site.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.440
This is where you will find logs.

03:40.770 --> 03:46.380
But mind, this is just for server specific logs, not BHP application logs.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.290
Next, safe Cengiz.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.470
And go back to the Zamp control panel.

04:05.570 --> 04:09.020
Restart Apache to apply the new configuration.

04:10.050 --> 04:16.380
Though you are not done yet to use the domain, you need to configure it locally on your system first

04:16.860 --> 04:18.960
and there is a separate lecture about that.
