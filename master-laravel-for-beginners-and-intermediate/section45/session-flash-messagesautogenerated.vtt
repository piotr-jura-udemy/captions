Let's think of a way that we can signal to the user that actually something has happened and we've started

00:08.200 --> 00:11.920
the new blog post into the database or otherwise.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.640
If something went wrong and we weren't able to save it.

00:16.120 --> 00:23.950
So there is a concept called flash messages which would be stored inside the user session and only would

00:23.950 --> 00:26.710
be visible for the next direct request.

00:26.740 --> 00:34.990
So the next request that will come after the one we are storing it inside a flash message so you can

00:34.990 --> 00:44.470
do that using the request session flash.

00:44.540 --> 00:56.840
So here you specify the key of your flash variable can be status and we can say that blog post was created.

00:56.860 --> 01:03.370
Now we only care about the successful status because we haven't get to the validation of the data yet.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.660
We'll do in a bit.

01:04.660 --> 01:13.480
So currently we only signal that something actually was successful and we will create this status variable

01:13.540 --> 01:16.120
inside the session which can be done read.

01:16.150 --> 01:18.490
And after that we'll be destroyed.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.960
So let's think of where we can actually displayed up.

01:23.020 --> 01:28.750
I think that for our simple application which looks like this there is only one labeled and couple of

01:28.750 --> 01:32.830
links we probably have to do that inside the layout.

01:33.220 --> 01:41.680
So here we have our menu and the yield content where we display all the content so we can use the if

01:41.680 --> 01:45.370
statement that we've learned about before.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.340
So let's create a scaffold for the if statement.

01:48.550 --> 01:55.090
And now we can check if the status variable is actually inside the session.

01:55.090 --> 01:59.940
So for this we can use their session helper function and it has a has method.

02:00.610 --> 02:02.980
So let's see if a session has status.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.740
So that's the variable we have created.

02:05.740 --> 02:15.120
We can additionally render something maybe we can even style it with green color of course later.

02:15.170 --> 02:21.370
I'll show you how to use bootstrap but for now let's just do it this way.

02:21.550 --> 02:31.720
And here will just echo the session and to read this variable that we have to start the flash message

02:31.770 --> 02:38.560
we will use the get method so get in the variable name is status.

02:38.630 --> 02:45.260
So now after starting a brand new blog post we'll be creating this stuff to the variable this flash

02:45.260 --> 02:51.160
variable and then reading it only once inside our layout only if it exists.

02:51.190 --> 02:56.330
So we'll only render that if this variable does exist.

02:56.450 --> 03:04.880
So let's post a new blog post created and you can see that our message that the blog post was created

03:05.120 --> 03:08.530
after you refresh it is being deleted.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.690
So it's no longer there now.

03:11.690 --> 03:18.140
There might also be a case where you would like to store this flash variable for more than one request

03:18.140 --> 03:24.260
for like next subsequent request and will not keep that inside the app.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.710
But I will just show you how you can do that.

03:27.140 --> 03:36.090
So we'll need a request object here because we will do that inside our show action and here we have

03:36.090 --> 03:45.900
access to the request which has session and we can do the re flash method call and this will keep the

03:47.100 --> 03:49.980
flash variable for the next request.

03:49.980 --> 03:57.780
So mind not cold out in loops because if you will always call re flash this will be stored forever and

03:57.810 --> 04:00.080
we do not want that.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.270
So now let's check if that works.

04:02.280 --> 04:07.190
So let's add a new blog post doesn't.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.800
So now let's check if that works and create a new blog post.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.670
Doesn't really matter what we type here.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.590
Now it is being created.

04:15.590 --> 04:22.100
We see our flash message and then if you will go to the least of blog posts you still see them as such

04:22.280 --> 04:26.180
but after you refresh it's no longer there.

04:26.180 --> 04:31.820
So I will remove that or maybe comment that out but just so you know how you can keep on message for

04:31.820 --> 04:33.230
one more request.
