In the last two lectures we learned the basics of defining routes using the route.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.130
Class methods.

00:13.130 --> 00:21.970
And also we learn the basics of rendering the views using the larval blade templating engine.

00:22.160 --> 00:30.440
But we only created individual pages like this home page or the contact page and also the blog post

00:30.440 --> 00:30.820
page.

00:30.830 --> 00:35.610
But there's no way to click through the links and go to this page.

00:35.610 --> 00:46.400
So now let's create a simple menu inside our layout and will use an unordered at least for that.

00:46.400 --> 00:55.310
So let's are the U L tag about the yield content and create two links.

00:55.310 --> 01:05.380
So the first one would be to the home page and the second one to the contact page.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.530
So those two URLs are slash contact

01:13.210 --> 01:13.770
okay.

01:13.810 --> 01:17.480
Now let's refresh this page.

01:19.070 --> 01:20.840
And of course this doesn't look great.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.210
Now we will get to that later.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.650
Let's see if that works so this menu is being rendered as part of the layout.

01:29.660 --> 01:32.200
So it would be always visible.

01:32.210 --> 01:37.890
And now we can easily navigate even if you will go to our blog post.

01:38.270 --> 01:39.770
You can see the same menu

01:44.390 --> 01:51.500
now you see here that we've defined those euros explicitly so they will always lead to the links that

01:51.500 --> 01:55.080
we've given inside the craft attribute.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.690
And let's now think what would happen if we will change the euro.

01:59.720 --> 02:05.330
For example for the contact page to contact to.

02:05.480 --> 02:11.070
So now if we would try to go to the contact page we get the funds.

02:11.140 --> 02:18.480
Hope 404 not found because we are trying to go to contact and the viewer has changed.

02:18.980 --> 02:26.830
So there has to be a better way to manage this and the race we will use then named routes.

02:27.350 --> 02:34.970
So the two other name to our route you have to add another method call after you defined the route.

02:35.060 --> 02:44.050
But first let's open the terminal and run peach partisan route least so you see there is this column

02:44.140 --> 02:45.380
name.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.780
So now let's add the names to our routes.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.920
So the first one would be home.

02:53.230 --> 02:57.120
Of course the contact would be contact.

02:57.190 --> 03:05.420
And the third one would be the blog post.

03:05.450 --> 03:12.950
Now if you rerun the P2P artisan route least you would see that those routes now contain the names so

03:12.950 --> 03:21.500
we can use that names to generate the actual you were out to our to the actual page instead of hard

03:21.500 --> 03:26.030
coding it inside templates or inside controllers.

03:26.090 --> 03:36.860
So let's go to our layout remove the direct you URL and we will render it by using double currently

03:36.860 --> 03:47.450
braces and to using the helper function root the route accepts a parameter which is the route name and

03:47.450 --> 03:55.370
since we've given our routes names let's open terminal again you can see that there is the home route

03:57.340 --> 03:58.500
and the contact route.

03:58.780 --> 04:03.160
So let's also remove this direct you Earl route.

04:03.190 --> 04:08.520
Contact.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.200
Now let's refresh this page.

04:10.270 --> 04:15.260
And if you will go to the home home page nothing changes because we haven't changed that.

04:15.490 --> 04:20.110
But if you will go to contact you can see that now it works.

04:20.110 --> 04:27.340
And it leads to the level that test slash contact tool because we've changed the URL inside our route

04:27.340 --> 04:38.270
definition file to contact to so if you will go again and reverted back to be just contact it should

04:38.270 --> 04:46.310
be automatically reflected if you click home and contact again you can see that the correct route was

04:46.400 --> 04:47.840
given.

04:47.840 --> 04:58.100
Now if you would like to add a link to your URL that has a parameter and in our case that's a blog post

04:59.660 --> 05:02.180
we can use the same root helper.

05:02.510 --> 05:06.120
And we have this route with the blog post name.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.150
So let's use it.

05:08.150 --> 05:19.070
The blog post and to pass a parameter we'll use an array the same as we did inside our route definitions.

05:19.070 --> 05:29.180
So it accepts two parameters the I.D. and an optional welcome parameter so let's pass the I.D. barometer

05:29.540 --> 05:30.380
to be one

05:35.080 --> 05:44.890
and let's close it and maybe we can call the link block post 1.

05:44.900 --> 05:54.710
Now we see this additional link and it is being correctly rendered as blog post slash 1 because we generate

05:54.710 --> 06:01.580
the route automatically in case we'll also like to modify the actual route like blog post to

06:05.520 --> 06:13.820
now when we refresh this page you can also see that now it leads to blog post to so let's fix that to

06:13.820 --> 06:15.140
be the correct one.

06:17.380 --> 06:24.490
And that would tweet about the basics of rooting and views and now follow to the next lecture when you

06:24.490 --> 06:27.640
will learn the concept of controllers.
