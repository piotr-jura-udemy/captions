WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:10.000
So up to this point we were displaying our list of blog posts and we allowed users to add them so we

00:10.000 --> 00:14.700
had to create for showing a forum and store for actually saving.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.420
A new blog post A.T..

00:16.930 --> 00:24.700
But now let's remind ourselves about the resource controls so you can go to the Vicki page about the

00:24.700 --> 00:25.840
resource controllers.

00:25.870 --> 00:29.630
And here you can see the resource methods table.

00:29.710 --> 00:35.380
So this is a list of all the actions that are being automatically created.

00:35.440 --> 00:41.970
When you define your controller inside the web BHP as a resource route.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.760
So that's our post controller.

00:45.070 --> 00:50.440
But we only specified that we want this for actions.

00:50.500 --> 00:59.860
So if you will go terminal and type HP artisan on the route least you can see that we have four actions

01:00.350 --> 01:04.030
enabled For our Post controller.

01:05.140 --> 01:12.100
So now let's go back to the table and see what actions are for displaying the edit form and actually

01:12.100 --> 01:16.210
modifying an existing entity.

01:16.210 --> 01:25.120
So what we have here first is the action called EDIT So it accepts one parameter and it is using the

01:25.210 --> 01:37.340
get verb so we can also enable it inside our roots so this will display the editing form.

01:37.750 --> 01:46.630
And the last one that the one that will actually modify the post is called update.

01:46.630 --> 01:52.520
So let's add update.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.890
Now let's go back to our resource method stable.

01:56.360 --> 02:02.240
So what you might have noticed is that we have the same your eyes for different actions.

02:02.270 --> 02:09.140
So it's the same for showing individual blog posts updating and also the same for destroying.

02:09.650 --> 02:16.150
So normally if you would paste this your url to your browser browser it will automatically do I get

02:16.150 --> 02:22.160
a request but there are also different verbs that mean different things.

02:22.160 --> 02:31.280
So it's a common practice that you would use put or a path for updating resources delete for deleting

02:31.340 --> 02:35.480
and post for creating.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.960
So normally this is often used if you create web API for example arrest API that you would use with

02:43.960 --> 02:54.940
your view J.S. or react apps but Lavell also suggests this practice to use these proper verbs HDP verbs

02:55.330 --> 03:03.760
with your normal form requests so just remember that that we are using specific HDP verbs for their

03:03.760 --> 03:10.980
actions but I will learn later show you how we will actually achieve that.

03:11.060 --> 03:20.830
Let's see our current route least So now you see that we have six routes and if you would compare that

03:20.950 --> 03:28.540
with what we have inside our resource metal table you can see that there are seven possible routes so

03:28.540 --> 03:33.280
there is another way we can specify which routes we want.

03:33.280 --> 03:40.840
So currently we use only to get only those that we want but since we are using six out of seven it will

03:40.840 --> 03:51.370
be easier to use except and that way will tell the resource controller only which ones we do not want

03:51.370 --> 03:54.050
to use.

03:54.160 --> 04:04.210
So instead of those six we'll just destroy and turn the resource controller that we want everything

04:04.330 --> 04:05.890
except the Destroy.

04:05.900 --> 04:10.350
So if you will now maybe clear the screen so it's invisible.

04:11.380 --> 04:18.310
Now if you were on the route list again you see that we have all this six routes except the destroy

04:18.310 --> 04:18.710
one.

04:19.030 --> 04:23.150
So this is a matter of your preference your choice.

04:23.350 --> 04:32.090
But generally it's just shorter syntax so I'd prefer to use whatever makes more sense.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.100
Now let's go back to the post controller and actually create those new routes.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.670
So we need to add new action

04:44.240 --> 04:46.090
and it would be called edit.

04:46.190 --> 04:50.920
So this would be the action to display on editing form.

04:50.930 --> 04:52.410
So this would be simple.

04:52.520 --> 04:59.060
We'll just return our view with the Post the Post's editor view.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.270
So we didn't have that view yet.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.490
And we can simply create it.

05:04.790 --> 05:17.180
So let's create edit blade BHP and for now let's just copy the contents of the Create template later.

05:17.340 --> 05:23.640
We'll see how we can make it more efficient because a lot of these things will be the same for both

05:23.640 --> 05:25.690
creating and editing.

05:25.800 --> 05:31.740
But for now let's just use a separate separate template.

05:32.250 --> 05:43.330
And the last action we need here is the update so let's create the method for the update action.

05:43.340 --> 05:53.010
So now this edit action actually has to accept an idea of the post that we are supposed to edit.

05:54.080 --> 06:00.740
So you can see what we did inside the show action.

06:00.740 --> 06:05.680
So we actually do not need that request because we have used that for reflux.

06:05.930 --> 06:16.180
But you can see that even though on the root it is actually posts and we use that I.D. So as I said

06:16.210 --> 06:19.840
before the name of your arguments that doesn't matter.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.240
They just have to be in order.

06:22.330 --> 06:29.350
So if you will have more arguments you will just add them using comma and you can give any name to them.

06:29.350 --> 06:38.920
But it's up to you if you prefer to use I.D. or the same name that is inside the root so saying that

06:38.950 --> 06:44.410
we can do the same with edit because we need a block post.

06:44.410 --> 06:54.340
Instance here so we can do the same what we did on the show action so we can use fined or fail so let's

06:54.430 --> 07:06.140
assign it to a post variable so block post fined or fail with the I.D. and we'll have to pass this post

07:06.800 --> 07:16.150
to our view and that's because we have to show the current values of the posts of the post to the user.

07:16.150 --> 07:21.650
And also we have to generate a proper route for updating a post.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.650
So now let's just start with this.

07:23.650 --> 07:35.320
Now inside our edit template now we do not use the store but instead we will use the update so let's

07:35.320 --> 07:38.770
modify the route to posts update.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.770
And it also has to have a parameter and the parameter name is post

07:47.870 --> 07:55.520
so we'll specify a parameter inside array and we have access to the post variable which we have passed.

07:56.970 --> 07:59.130
So this is how it will look.

07:59.130 --> 07:59.710
Currently

08:06.320 --> 08:16.410
now since I told you that for the updating actions we'll use put or puff and yet this form has metal

08:16.440 --> 08:22.980
posts so there is no other way inside HD email forums to specify the method.

08:23.210 --> 08:35.740
So the method only accepts get or post so what we have to do is called The Method spoofing so we can

08:35.800 --> 08:47.700
use method directive and specify the HDP verb so method spoofing is some I somehow knew some inside

08:47.700 --> 08:56.670
the Lavell where you will send a post request for example but yet it will also include a hidden field

08:56.940 --> 09:02.710
called underscore method and then this will be treated by larval like UFOs.

09:02.750 --> 09:09.120
Yeah like if you would send an actual request with the put method.

09:12.570 --> 09:17.660
So let's save the changes and now we have our values.

09:17.660 --> 09:26.040
So we have to fetch the values that we have passed through our post variable and since we have this

09:26.160 --> 09:34.650
old helper here to display the values that didn't pass the validation it also accepts a second parameter

09:35.430 --> 09:36.800
which is a default value.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.620
So if there wasn't anything sent before.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.840
So nothing is flashed to the session already.

09:42.840 --> 09:47.680
We can provide the default value and it's a good occasion to put here.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.550
The actual post title

09:53.640 --> 10:01.110
so this was words like initially will always show the post title because nothing was said before but

10:01.110 --> 10:07.410
then if the user would send something and it won't pass the validation it he will see everything that

10:07.440 --> 10:11.040
he sent previously and it was flashed through this session.

10:11.730 --> 10:16.260
So now let's do the same with the content.

10:16.260 --> 10:20.200
So here really want that post content attribute.

10:21.120 --> 10:27.960
Now finally we have to change the label to update and we can keep this error as the same will eventually

10:27.960 --> 10:31.240
make one template out of date.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.630
Now let's go to our index.

10:35.910 --> 10:41.260
As it contains a list of all the blog posts we've a link to them.

10:41.310 --> 10:53.010
So now let's put another link to modify an existing blog post so we'll use the root and the root is

10:53.130 --> 10:54.660
as you see here it is.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.110
Edit So posts.

10:56.160 --> 11:03.600
Edit and the post is the post I d.

11:13.610 --> 11:15.160
And maybe the label would be.

11:15.390 --> 11:20.580
Edit So now let's see List of our blog posts.

11:20.590 --> 11:25.420
So we have a title and under it there is a link to edit and of course it works.

11:25.420 --> 11:33.220
You can open any blog post and you'll see the original title and content that you will be able to update

11:33.490 --> 11:36.900
but we'll do that in the next lecture.
