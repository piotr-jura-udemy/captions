00:03.020 --> 00:09.580
In the last lecture we've learned how to configure our database connection to the my sequel database.

00:09.620 --> 00:16.850
And we've also learned were all the credentials for the database and all the connection parameters are

00:16.850 --> 00:21.520
stored and that that they are stored in environment variables.

00:21.680 --> 00:29.720
And for the local development environment we use a file called Dot and to keep the values of those environment

00:29.720 --> 00:30.740
variables.

00:30.800 --> 00:38.860
And of course this is not only for the databases it's for the whole of our application.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.640
Now you can see that we have some values set for the database the user name and password.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.560
And we do not know if they are correct.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.820
And if you are using some they want to be correct.

00:51.330 --> 00:58.140
So to find out what are the credentials for example you should go to the some folder find some files

00:59.280 --> 01:00.530
and locate that peach.

01:00.530 --> 01:02.020
Be my admin.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.200
So Mike this might differ on Windows.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.800
You just need to find the speech.

01:05.790 --> 01:13.230
Be my admin folder and inside it there is that config in peach bee file so open it.

01:14.160 --> 01:21.450
And around the line 13 you shouldn't you should see the user and password so user name is Root password

01:21.540 --> 01:22.500
is empty.

01:23.460 --> 01:30.840
So let's modify the user name to route remove the password.

01:30.840 --> 01:38.130
So now it is empty and if you remember we created a database called La rather so it's not homestead

01:38.190 --> 01:40.190
it is lava.

01:41.880 --> 01:47.220
So now our connections should be configured properly and the rest of the parameters stays the same.

01:47.220 --> 01:56.690
The host is as you see on the screen and the port the typical my sequel port free free 0 6 now that

01:56.690 --> 01:59.410
we have our database connection configured.

01:59.540 --> 02:03.280
It's time to talk about the concept of migrations.

02:03.560 --> 02:08.690
So migrations lets you keep your database schema version.

02:08.870 --> 02:14.990
What that means is that whenever you would like to change your database schema like Daniel table or

02:14.990 --> 02:23.120
a field or change something you will put that into a migration file and migrations can be found inside

02:23.120 --> 02:34.120
the database migrations folder so Lavell comes with to migration files out of the box and let's take

02:34.120 --> 02:40.450
a look at the one of them so you can see that the migration file contains a class which describes what's

02:40.450 --> 02:47.090
this migration is doing and studied extends the base migration class from LA Bravo.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.730
And it has two methods the up method and down method.

02:52.750 --> 03:00.790
So what that does is whenever we change something inside our database schema we are calling the up method

03:00.850 --> 03:04.600
or basically the la la travel is calling this method.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.750
It means like when we are moving forward we create some things we would like to change some things or

03:10.750 --> 03:18.720
add a new table the app is being called but sometimes we might make a mistake and we want to revert

03:18.720 --> 03:19.650
that change.

03:19.750 --> 03:27.520
And this is what down method is doing so without going into much details right now what this code is

03:27.520 --> 03:28.690
doing.

03:28.690 --> 03:36.370
You might see that there is a call to create on schema which creates a table with some specific fields

03:37.000 --> 03:41.190
and the down method drops this table.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.940
So this is how it works.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.060
The app is always called when you move forward you will create something you modified something and

03:49.090 --> 03:52.590
if you want to reverse this change that down is called.

03:52.600 --> 04:01.140
So you should typically implement those two methods in your migrations now let's take a look at this

04:01.140 --> 04:08.820
migration that comes with Lara travel which tries to create a new users table so to run this migration

04:09.120 --> 04:16.520
you need to open the terminal and let's run peach artisan to see the list of available comments.

04:16.650 --> 04:20.080
So at the top you should see them migrate.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.770
So I'm selecting it now.

04:21.800 --> 04:29.940
Then my grid will run older my database migrations that haven't been run yet and it will call the up

04:29.940 --> 04:36.960
functions of those migration files so we'll modify our database schema forward.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.910
There is another.

04:38.010 --> 04:44.090
Another comment from the migrate namespace and it is called a rollback.

04:44.130 --> 04:47.720
And as you can see it will roll back the last database migration.

04:47.730 --> 04:52.210
So any last change that we've made we can roll back using this command.

04:52.230 --> 04:57.150
For example if you see that you that you actually made a mistake.

04:57.450 --> 04:59.030
So let's run it now.

04:59.030 --> 05:09.870
Peach P artisan migrate and you can see that we have an error and it is in the migration file provided

05:09.870 --> 05:17.610
by LA travel so you can see from the status that we have output at here that it is trying to migrate

05:17.730 --> 05:25.290
using this create user stable and that there is a syntax error or access violation that specified Key

05:25.380 --> 05:35.070
was too long and the maximum key length is seven six seven and it is happening on the user stable on

05:35.070 --> 05:38.520
the unique constraint for the email.

05:38.520 --> 05:42.890
So let's locate it now and that's this line.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.860
So we are adding an email field and making it unique.

05:48.030 --> 05:56.890
But what you have to know is that when we are using the UTF 8 character said in my sequel.

05:57.300 --> 06:06.930
Each character holds free bytes so free bytes multiplied by two hundred fifty five which is the default

06:07.290 --> 06:19.440
length of a string field which gives less than 7 6 7 but we are not using the UTF 8 and coding instead

06:20.190 --> 06:29.400
as we see inside our database config and also as we created the database we are using that UTF 8 and

06:29.400 --> 06:38.900
before which means we are using four bytes for every character and if we multiply two hundred fifty

06:38.900 --> 06:47.190
five the default length of the virtual field which is being used for the email we will actually get

06:47.190 --> 06:53.150
more than this so we'll exceed this limit for a key so to quickly fixed this.

06:53.250 --> 07:03.240
And also remember it for the future you should set the length of such fields to be the maximum of hundred

07:03.340 --> 07:12.090
ninety one so let's take a look if the other migration file might have the same problem and it does

07:12.120 --> 07:20.370
because it's also defining an email field when it is creating the new password resets table and also

07:20.370 --> 07:24.020
using the default length which is two hundred fifty five.

07:24.240 --> 07:33.050
So let's change it 291 because it's also creating an index of on that field.

07:33.120 --> 07:40.350
Now let's go back to the browser and you can see that a lot of the database already has two tables and

07:40.350 --> 07:47.040
it's because those tables were created by dos immigrations but they failed to ring it and they failed

07:47.040 --> 07:53.850
to add are constraints or keys that they wanted to add so they are incorrect not in sync with what we

07:53.850 --> 07:55.860
have inside the migration files.

07:56.760 --> 08:04.770
So let's choose the drop option after selecting those two tables and confirm with yes to delete those

08:04.770 --> 08:07.110
tables manually.

08:07.290 --> 08:19.100
And now let's go back to our terminal and again run peach bee artisan migrate and now you see that all

08:19.100 --> 08:22.260
the migrations have run successfully.

08:22.680 --> 08:29.670
So let's take a look at what we have right now inside the database so you can see free tables the two

08:29.670 --> 08:38.590
tables that we wanted to create or the larva by default create migrations for and the migrations table.

08:38.700 --> 08:43.830
So the migration stable will hold every migration that was executed.

08:43.830 --> 08:48.900
So it contains their migration name and the outer generated ideas.

08:49.470 --> 08:56.600
And also there are their tables the user stable which has all the fields that were defined.

08:56.850 --> 09:00.750
You can also see that the var chart is 191.

09:00.810 --> 09:08.040
As we define it and by default when you haven't specified the length it is two hundred fifty five and

09:08.040 --> 09:12.330
the same is with the password resets table that lava provided.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.070
So that would be about migrations in this lecture.

09:17.130 --> 09:23.340
Let's move to the next one when we will actually create our first on migration.
