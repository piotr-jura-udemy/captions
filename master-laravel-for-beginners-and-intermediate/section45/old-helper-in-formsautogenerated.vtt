00:01.650 --> 00:07.650
In the couple of last lectures we've seen how we can validate the input from the user that is being

00:07.650 --> 00:09.270
sent through the forum.

00:10.020 --> 00:16.940
And also we've seen how we can simplify the validation by using the forum requests.

00:16.950 --> 00:25.110
So when we get to the store method the store action we can immediately assume that we have the valid

00:25.110 --> 00:26.690
data here.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.860
Now let's see another example.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.280
And another useful feature flown from Lara.

00:32.310 --> 00:40.950
So imagine that you wrote something and it is incorrect but you would like to keep this data inside

00:40.950 --> 00:41.790
the forum.

00:41.790 --> 00:44.960
When redirect happens after repress create.

00:45.240 --> 00:52.110
In this case we see that the title has to be at least five characters and the content has to be at least

00:52.350 --> 00:52.960
10.

00:53.700 --> 01:04.500
So let's write something like hey and content something that is less than the minimum required for title

01:04.530 --> 01:05.580
and content.

01:05.700 --> 01:14.790
So to give the user a chance to fix whatever he has written if you will press create it just gets lost.

01:14.790 --> 01:21.180
So there is a way we can handle that in Lavell and it is called the old helper.

01:21.180 --> 01:28.950
So when the data is being sent it is being flashed and is incorrect so invalid it is being flashed to

01:28.950 --> 01:29.950
the session.

01:29.970 --> 01:37.170
So we talked about flushing to the session before it happens ultimately with errors for example when

01:37.440 --> 01:44.400
the validator will encounter any errors it will flash it to their errors variable that is that is then

01:44.490 --> 01:51.760
accessible throughout all your blade templates so the same happens with input.

01:51.810 --> 01:57.100
Now if you will go to the create blade BHP file you can specify.

01:57.110 --> 02:06.190
Additionally value and the value would be the result of the old helper method and its only parameter

02:06.190 --> 02:07.990
would be the field name.

02:07.990 --> 02:17.040
So the old title and for the content will use the old helper with the content value.

02:17.550 --> 02:23.630
So the good thing about this old helper is that you can use it whenever you need to.

02:23.640 --> 02:29.440
So sometimes you might not want to use it for example for passwords or any sensitive data.

02:29.640 --> 02:38.310
But in this case it's safe to let users correct whatever they have typed like the blog post title and

02:38.310 --> 02:39.510
the content.

02:39.510 --> 02:44.160
So let's save the changes and see what we get.

02:44.160 --> 02:54.250
So let's type the title and the content now press create and you can see that if we have invalid fields

02:54.290 --> 03:01.630
or both are invited in this case but we still give users the chance to fix this and send the correct

03:01.690 --> 03:02.430
values.
