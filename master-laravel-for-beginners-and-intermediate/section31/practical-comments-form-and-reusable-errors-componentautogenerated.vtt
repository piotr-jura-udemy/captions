00:01.080 --> 00:04.390
In this lecture we will work with the larval views.

00:04.590 --> 00:12.120
So first thing we'll do is we will create our forum for adding new comments to our blog post only for

00:12.120 --> 00:14.360
the authenticated users.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.450
That's nothing new.

00:15.450 --> 00:23.140
We did that before but also we will refactor existing code using what we have learned so far.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.740
So we created this forum for adding blog posts.

00:26.760 --> 00:34.020
Way before before we knew a lot of stuff that we now know and if you will try to submit it with invalid

00:34.020 --> 00:41.580
data you'll see some error messages that are not really visually appealing and will refactor that to

00:41.580 --> 00:50.520
create a common errors component which will then use on our new form for adding comments and we'll also

00:50.520 --> 00:58.680
reuse that here when we display the errors when the data for adding a blog post is somehow invalid.

00:58.740 --> 01:07.040
So let's go ahead and start working So first we'll start with adding a new form for adding the blog

01:07.040 --> 01:16.050
posts so let's go to the Visual Studio code and what we see here is our create form so we'll copy some

01:16.050 --> 01:21.600
of the code not to bother you with typing especially that those is this is nothing new.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.460
You did that before and it won't change much but also will refactor this fragment to make it a reusable

01:29.460 --> 01:34.470
component that will display errors in a more appealing manner.

01:34.470 --> 01:40.500
OK so let's go ahead now inside our resources views folder.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.120
We do not have our comments folder so let's create it.

01:44.120 --> 01:44.460
Now

01:47.700 --> 01:53.290
so this is our new view namespace for all the templates related to comments.

01:53.430 --> 02:00.570
Now since comments are only part of a blog post for now we do not have a case where they should be displayed

02:00.570 --> 02:07.860
separately will just create start with creating a partial component we'll call it underscore a forum

02:08.250 --> 02:17.430
blade BHP and this forum will be put inside the individual blog post page on the show blade BHP template

02:17.460 --> 02:20.470
of the posts to display a forum.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.140
Only four out integrated users.

02:23.490 --> 02:28.680
So since this is a party all component parts are a partial partial view.

02:28.680 --> 02:36.800
It doesn't need to extend and layout we can just copy this code from the create template to have our

02:36.900 --> 02:40.010
bases for our forum structure.

02:40.050 --> 02:47.910
Now we don't need this include but we definitely need to order CSR Rev token which would create our

02:47.910 --> 02:51.850
hidden input field with their CSR f token.

02:51.870 --> 02:58.830
Now we do not yet have a controller so no route would be specified but we can use the button so we can

02:58.830 --> 03:03.750
say at comment okay.

03:03.790 --> 03:16.040
Now we will also need a field to type in the actual comment so let's reuse what we have inside this

03:16.040 --> 03:16.740
forum.

03:16.970 --> 03:24.660
But since we want to allow some longer text let's modify this to text area.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.340
Now we also don't need a default value.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.440
And let's close this element now inside the comment model.

03:33.440 --> 03:40.190
We also have a field called content so we can reuse that but we want to use the label at all.

03:40.190 --> 03:44.870
So let's remove this from the component.

03:44.870 --> 03:49.770
Now I've said that comments could only be posted by authenticated users.

03:49.850 --> 03:55.210
So let's use the health directive.

03:55.530 --> 04:03.710
So if the user is authenticated he would only then see this forum otherwise he might see something else.

04:03.740 --> 04:13.040
But first let's wrap all of this partial component inside a DPH that will have some marking at the bottom

04:13.190 --> 04:18.260
end marking out the top let's say marking too.

04:18.290 --> 04:18.820
All right.

04:18.830 --> 04:26.570
Now let us in then that and yeah well if user is not authenticated he might see some text that well

04:26.600 --> 04:36.970
he should do something like authenticate so we can do a sign in to post comments and this could even

04:36.970 --> 04:37.720
be a link

04:41.760 --> 04:45.510
so that would be a link to our sign root.

04:45.570 --> 04:54.090
Now we can use the root helper and if you remember it or not the route to logging is called logging.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.480
Well unless you have called it differently.

04:57.410 --> 04:57.990
Okay.

04:57.990 --> 05:04.090
And well we can also add a horizontal line at the bottom.

05:04.270 --> 05:13.750
So basically now our forum for posting comments is kind of ready we can insert this inside the show

05:13.840 --> 05:16.580
template.

05:16.620 --> 05:24.420
Well I think we can put this just below the comments header section and we can use include and just

05:24.420 --> 05:30.730
include the comments don't underscore form.

05:31.230 --> 05:31.630
OK.

05:31.710 --> 05:34.830
Save the changes and let's refresh the page

05:37.470 --> 05:39.120
now after it reloads.

05:39.150 --> 05:43.080
We should see a nice form with the button to add a comment.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.690
It doesn't do anything yet.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.320
We'll handle that in a moment.

05:46.350 --> 05:50.090
But you can see that since I am authenticated I can see this form.

05:50.100 --> 05:55.510
But if I will log out and then I will visit one of the blog posts.

05:55.510 --> 05:57.980
Doesn't really matter which one.

05:58.320 --> 06:08.550
Now I should instead of the forum see the link but it apparently doesn't work and let's see why.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.710
So it seems I haven't closed the deal talk.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.460
And also I didn't even close the opening.

06:15.460 --> 06:16.000
Deep dark.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.220
So let's fix that.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.130
Save the changes and it should work.

06:19.140 --> 06:23.880
Now now after refreshing the layout should now look correct.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.820
We see the link to signing.

06:25.870 --> 06:34.780
If we are authenticated now let's work on this part that will let us display arrows using our single

06:34.780 --> 06:42.510
component by accessing these global errors variable that is bank available to all your views.

06:42.520 --> 06:50.620
If there are any validation errors so let's go ahead and create a new file inside the components folder

06:50.650 --> 06:53.050
and call it errors.

06:53.050 --> 06:56.160
Blade BHP

06:58.780 --> 07:05.240
now we can copy this fragment to verify if there actually are any errors to be displayed.

07:08.740 --> 07:19.020
Now let's go to the app service provider and register this new component with underlie us so it's components

07:20.370 --> 07:27.460
errors and we wound up under the errors alliance okay.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.620
Now we also do not want it to be displayed.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.240
Well not really visually appealing.

07:33.370 --> 07:41.120
So let's modify this code to have some margin at the top margin at the bottom using empty and end B

07:41.120 --> 07:44.470
classes and also remove list from it

07:48.680 --> 07:55.370
and now instead of displaying our list element what we will do is we'll use our bootstrap class called

07:55.460 --> 08:01.730
alert and will display it using the red color like using the danger class.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.150
So let's copy this fragment and paste that into our template

08:10.370 --> 08:20.270
reformat so we can keep those classes and only think we have to do is to echo the error variable which

08:20.270 --> 08:24.080
we iterate over all the errors.

08:24.080 --> 08:24.360
Okay.

08:24.380 --> 08:35.060
So basically there is our component now instead of doing this inside the underscore form late for posts

08:37.250 --> 08:49.680
we can do arrows and arrows let's verify if that actually works by trying to add blog post first we

08:49.680 --> 08:51.360
have to logging obviously.

08:51.910 --> 08:52.460
OK.

08:52.470 --> 08:53.640
Let's submit something.

08:53.790 --> 08:54.120
Yes.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.100
So it works.

08:55.110 --> 09:01.680
And now we'll be able to reuse this component but first we of course have to implement some logic that

09:01.680 --> 09:05.450
will add those comments and we'll do that in the next lecture.
