00:00.950 --> 00:07.700
Let's take a bird's eye overview of the tools available in the Laravel framework to make it easy to

00:07.700 --> 00:09.180
work with databases.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.910
By the way, this diagram is available for you to download.

00:13.670 --> 00:19.540
First off, reading and storing data can be achieved using Roskill.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.490
Queries are more object oriented.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.820
Alternative is to use query builder.

00:25.790 --> 00:30.030
It lets you build queries by fluently calling methods.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.650
And finally, there is the eloquent or M.

00:35.110 --> 00:42.760
In this course, we will mostly use eloquent is the Laravel implementation of the active record button.

00:43.210 --> 00:50.590
Active record, in summary, means that each database table will have its own dedicated P2P class,

00:50.950 --> 00:58.740
also called model model can be used to create, modify and delete table records.

00:59.290 --> 01:05.620
Note the query builder is often used together with eloquent were more complicated.

01:05.620 --> 01:15.850
Queries are made to create, modify and delete database tables you can use migration's each migration

01:15.850 --> 01:22.440
is a class that defines what changes should be applied to the database schema.

01:23.140 --> 01:27.120
These changes can then be applied and rolled back.

01:28.510 --> 01:34.160
Finally, seeding tools lets you easily populate the database with data.

01:34.750 --> 01:42.880
This can be either real data needed in your application or data generated for testing purposes.
