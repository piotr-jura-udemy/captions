00:00.970 --> 00:07.810
The most convenient way of creating migrations is to create them together with the models, models can

00:07.810 --> 00:12.820
be generated using their partisan make model commands.

00:14.080 --> 00:20.060
Adding debt and flag would also generate a migration file alongside.

00:20.650 --> 00:24.520
So let's make a blog post model.

00:25.750 --> 00:35.710
So you do that by adding the model name just after their command models are classes by default, they

00:35.710 --> 00:40.920
leave since Lavallade in the App Models directory.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.900
We'll get back to models later.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.090
Now let's open the cocreator migration file.

00:51.940 --> 01:02.440
At first glance, we can see the migration boiler plate has prefilled up and down Method's buglers names

01:02.560 --> 01:08.830
should be in Studley case, also known as the Pascall case.

01:11.850 --> 01:15.000
Every word starts with uppercase.

01:16.360 --> 01:25.570
The output generated table names are in that snake case instead, meaning boards are lower case separated

01:25.570 --> 01:27.220
by underscores.

01:28.700 --> 01:37.620
Notice how create and drop even exists, schema, class, static methods are used to create and delete

01:37.620 --> 01:41.560
the table if it exists already, respectively.

01:42.610 --> 01:46.750
Every table needs to have the primary key.

01:47.820 --> 01:59.280
And the Blueprint I.D. method adds one by default, the big integer type is used for that in my school

01:59.700 --> 02:02.280
and it is an auto generated.

02:03.530 --> 02:14.570
The timestamps method will add to fields called Created Out and updated at this by convention will be

02:14.570 --> 02:22.790
updated when using eloquent models on the model creation and then every time the model is actually updated.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.960
Let's try to add some fields on our own.

02:30.590 --> 02:36.590
We might need a string type column called title.

02:40.090 --> 02:44.900
And text type column called Content.

02:46.360 --> 02:53.830
Notice how the method name defines the type of the column and the first parameter is the actual name

02:53.830 --> 03:04.150
of the column blueprint methods names obstruct the actual database types as this vary between database

03:04.150 --> 03:04.810
engines.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.460
Well, it also means migration's should be database agnostic.

03:10.370 --> 03:15.040
Finally, let's see how to apply and roll back migration's.

03:16.150 --> 03:19.390
But first, let's see the current state of the database.

03:19.420 --> 03:22.060
You should have this four tables.

03:25.230 --> 03:32.130
Now, let's run bipartisan migrate to apply the migration and see if the table was created.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.050
Everything seems to.

03:36.070 --> 03:42.460
Go find now let's refresh the view and there it is, our new blog posts, stable.

03:48.350 --> 03:53.900
Now, the artisan, my great roll back.

03:55.550 --> 04:02.300
Should be able to back off this change by deleting the table, let's run it and check out what happens.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.700
So it seems that it went fine.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.740
Now let's see.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.350
There is no blog posts table.

04:11.520 --> 04:18.060
Well, it seems it was actually deleted, so this is how you can back off from any changes you make

04:18.060 --> 04:19.680
to the database schema.

04:21.370 --> 04:28.390
Now, we actually want this table to be created, so let's round up artisan migrate again, it was just

04:28.390 --> 04:32.590
a demonstration of how to migrate and how to roll back.

04:34.370 --> 04:40.580
Finally, you might be happy to know that in the immigration section of Laravel documentation, there

04:40.580 --> 04:49.160
is this available column Times section which lists all the methods available on the blueprint class,

04:49.880 --> 04:57.680
and it lists the method names how they should be used and also what's the equivalent type that would

04:57.680 --> 04:59.300
be created on the database.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.610
So that's very useful.

05:01.790 --> 05:03.350
Be sure to check it out.
