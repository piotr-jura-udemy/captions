Database Migration's is the tool to change the database schema.

00:06.420 --> 00:14.820
For example, every time you need to create a new table or add new columns to an existing table, you

00:14.820 --> 00:17.220
should create a new migration file.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.270
Every migration file has a very simple structure.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.940
It is a PE class with two methods called up and down.

00:27.750 --> 00:34.050
Up is responsible for making the changes forward down for rolling them back.

00:34.650 --> 00:37.770
Laravel gives you two useful classes.

00:37.770 --> 00:45.710
Schema and blueprint schema has methods to create, change and delete database tables.

00:46.560 --> 00:52.290
Blueprint is used to create or modify or delete individual table columns.

00:53.040 --> 01:02.970
Migrations are applied and rolled back using artisan commands, artisan migrate to apply outstanding

01:02.970 --> 01:03.870
migrations.

01:04.740 --> 01:10.650
Artisan migrate roll back to roll back loves to run migrations.

01:11.690 --> 01:20.390
Whenever you run Migration's Laravel checks in the special database table, it creates whether the migration's

01:20.390 --> 01:21.560
were already run.

01:22.190 --> 01:24.380
If they were not, Laravel runs them.

01:24.740 --> 01:28.340
The name of this table is configurable by default.

01:28.730 --> 01:31.670
It is surprisingly called Migration's.

01:33.400 --> 01:41.560
Let's take a look at some of the migrations that came out of the box with Laravel, as you see, all

01:41.560 --> 01:46.470
migrations are kept in the database migrations folder.

01:47.410 --> 01:53.190
Their names contain the date, time and short description.

01:53.770 --> 01:55.420
That's a useful convention.

01:55.420 --> 02:03.550
It allows Laravel to figure out the order in which migrations should be run from oldest to newest.

02:03.550 --> 02:09.330
First also noticed, the most migration files look similar.

02:10.060 --> 02:14.080
There is the are methods and down methods.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.860
Both start with a call to one of their key Mamet's.

02:19.990 --> 02:28.270
Then schema class methods often accept an anonymous function, which further using their blueprint class

02:28.930 --> 02:37.390
instance, allows for specific things to happen to a table, usually adding, modifying or deleting

02:37.390 --> 02:38.740
table columns.
