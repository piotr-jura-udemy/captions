00:00.920 --> 00:07.790
The purpose of this lecture is to show you how you can create something like this so you can add a prefix

00:07.880 --> 00:16.520
of the desired language of the user to the URL without modifying the lateral application itself and

00:16.700 --> 00:20.510
modifying any roots and their definition in Lavell.

00:20.570 --> 00:28.100
So what we wanted to achieve is that if there is a language prefix before all of our normal routes like

00:28.100 --> 00:32.860
posts there home page specific post or user profile.

00:33.080 --> 00:40.850
This is redirecting to the actual travel route but with additional query parameter specifying what is

00:40.850 --> 00:44.210
the actual desired locale of the user.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.360
So what language does he wants to see.

00:47.360 --> 00:54.230
And that's why we initially added that inside our local middleware that we are checking for.

00:54.230 --> 01:03.120
This query parameter the local and then setting it into the session if it is present now going back

01:03.120 --> 01:05.940
to the DOT HD access file.

01:05.940 --> 01:13.110
So this file contains some additional configuration to the Apache web server and this will only apply

01:13.110 --> 01:16.920
to the directory when this fire file is being found.

01:17.310 --> 01:24.900
And since this is our public directory where we have our index BHP file to which older traffic is directed

01:24.990 --> 01:34.380
in light of all application it basically applies to our whole lot of application.

01:34.410 --> 01:40.090
Now this file came as it is with the brand new lot of our setup that we've created.

01:40.170 --> 01:48.360
So we haven't modified anything in here and I will also want go into details of what all of those options

01:48.420 --> 01:48.870
do.

01:49.500 --> 01:56.760
So this is a quite complicated topic and well it's something that we could talk about for hours on how

01:56.760 --> 02:03.800
to configure Apache but just to let you know you can read about that if you are interested.

02:03.810 --> 02:10.740
So there are those free links that I will include to this lecture which explain how to use the mode

02:10.800 --> 02:14.230
rewrite module of Apache.

02:14.260 --> 02:21.150
There are a couple of examples in this particular page so we might read it to see what you can achieve

02:21.150 --> 02:23.490
with that and well how it works.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.010
What's the syntax.

02:26.030 --> 02:34.310
Now we will also use regular expressions to match the actual you URL with that language like this and

02:34.400 --> 02:41.330
it might be useful to take a look at this page and read about regular expressions in Apache configuration

02:41.330 --> 02:47.060
file so we understand what of all those symbols will do and what they are for.

02:47.060 --> 02:55.810
I also want explained that you can just go to this link and read that in case you have any doubts now

02:55.810 --> 02:57.200
finally there is this.

02:57.220 --> 03:04.930
Well I would say biggest link word that a lot of information about their specific directives what options

03:04.930 --> 03:11.010
they have what variables can be passed and how to use them and what all of those symbols mean.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.150
What are those options for

03:16.690 --> 03:23.170
so you might have a better understanding of what's happening inside all of those specific rules.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.470
But now let's get to the point.

03:25.480 --> 03:33.070
So our change would actually be a one liner and what we want to achieve is what we want to create a

03:33.070 --> 03:34.300
redirect.

03:34.300 --> 03:40.990
If we find that there is a language prefix from the language that languages that we support we want

03:40.990 --> 03:44.380
to redirect that to the actual lot of route.

03:44.470 --> 03:47.420
But with the additional query parameter.

03:47.500 --> 03:54.430
So as I've said since this is our one liner we'll use the redirect March directive to redirect to the

03:54.430 --> 03:55.940
proper page.

03:56.230 --> 03:59.400
So there are two parts that we need to specify here.

03:59.410 --> 04:05.530
The first one is that you are L that has to be matched and we need to get some parameters from it namely

04:05.890 --> 04:13.480
the language that the user wants and then we'll redirect that to the new URL converting this language

04:13.960 --> 04:17.430
to a query parameter called local.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.570
So we'll be using regular expressions in this first argument.

04:22.570 --> 04:28.510
So we start with well beginning of the query string then we will create a group.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.340
So we need this parameter.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.020
So we need you need a group for it.

04:32.050 --> 04:36.310
So we can reference that later in this second argument.

04:36.370 --> 04:47.090
So this can be either English or German or Spanish and of course before it we need to match slash because

04:47.090 --> 04:53.460
well basically this whereas as you can see they really have to start with a slash.

04:53.470 --> 04:59.790
All right then next part is well there might be an additional slash after the language.

04:59.870 --> 05:01.790
So let's take a look at this example.

05:01.790 --> 05:06.350
So here there isn't any and this means just go to their home page.

05:06.350 --> 05:14.880
But in all other examples there is a slash after the language so we can match it optionally the question

05:14.880 --> 05:21.540
mark Matt means that the previous expression or while the previous literal text should be matched or

05:21.540 --> 05:21.890
not.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.860
So it doesn't really matter if it's matched or not.

05:25.920 --> 05:32.410
And now we have a second group which means that we will need this parameter for the rewrite.

05:32.790 --> 05:37.590
And this is basically everything which the DOT character is for so much.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.100
Any character.

05:39.450 --> 05:45.870
And then we are the quantity fire which means how many times we want to match this any character.

05:46.230 --> 05:50.320
And using this symbol it means match it zero or more times.

05:50.330 --> 05:55.350
So that might be an empty string or a string of length a hundred.

05:56.520 --> 06:03.990
So we see and close those two things in groups because we will have to reference that back in the second

06:04.110 --> 06:04.840
argument.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.860
Well also this year L is optional.

06:06.870 --> 06:09.380
So we need to ask this question mark.

06:09.430 --> 06:15.240
Slash is optional and then this one is also optional.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.320
Now what we redirect that to is a slash.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.280
Then we reference a group using a dollar sign and a number.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.580
So the groups are numbered from 1 2.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.580
And any additional groups will have the corresponding numbers.

06:31.620 --> 06:38.970
So we reference the actual you around the actual valid lot of value URL and then we just add a query

06:38.970 --> 06:49.720
parameter and this references the group one which happens to contain the language so using this read

06:49.740 --> 06:56.890
redirect March directive we will we will achieve exactly what you see in those examples here.

06:56.940 --> 07:03.990
So we have to match a slash then one of the supported languages then optionally another slash and then

07:04.050 --> 07:11.190
after that the remaining part of the URL which would actually match a valid URL that we have defined

07:11.280 --> 07:14.100
for our roots in the lateral application.

07:15.090 --> 07:24.450
So now you just need to save the changes and basically go to the browser open our new incognito window

07:24.450 --> 07:31.470
to make sure that your browser doesn't have anything cached it just might not pick out changes and let's

07:31.470 --> 07:32.790
try the first example.

07:32.790 --> 07:41.400
So a lot of older tests large the E and we expect the home page to be displayed in German so we can

07:41.400 --> 07:41.880
see that.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.040
Well this is the expected outcome.

07:44.550 --> 07:50.310
So we are being redirected to a lot of older test with this query parameter and since this parameter

07:50.310 --> 07:57.870
is now stored on this session when you click some additional links you do not really need to pass this

07:57.870 --> 08:00.930
parameter around this local parameter.

08:00.930 --> 08:08.360
You just stay in German unless you do something else like for example you might visit the lot of that

08:08.390 --> 08:11.170
test slash e s posts.

08:11.610 --> 08:14.330
So now we expect to see the blog post least.

08:14.490 --> 08:21.940
But the page should be in Spanish and it is you can see that now everything is in Spanish.

08:21.970 --> 08:28.660
And also when you follow those links the page stays in Spanish.

08:28.660 --> 08:33.540
Now obviously when we do not specify a language we would say we would get the default.

08:33.540 --> 08:36.320
So nothing changes in this particular case.

08:36.330 --> 08:44.130
But then if you would visit this page in New Top then well you will just get whatever you have configured

08:45.690 --> 08:54.290
inside the local middleware so this happens to be the fallback local so I hope this is understandable.

08:54.290 --> 09:00.680
This is a simple change and well it works only with the Apache because this file this HD access file

09:00.710 --> 09:03.950
is just specific to the Apache web server.

09:03.950 --> 09:10.820
And since this course read commands to use stamp Well I'm showing you the configuration for Apache but

09:10.820 --> 09:18.260
of course if you are using something else like engine X or the BJP built in server this won't work for

09:18.260 --> 09:26.120
you unfortunately so well I might add some additional links on how to do that in others servers later

09:26.150 --> 09:32.420
but for now we are just showing it how it works with the default set up for this course.
