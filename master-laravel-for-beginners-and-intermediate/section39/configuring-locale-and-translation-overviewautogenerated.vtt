00:00.820 --> 00:07.580
Now let's begin the first practical lecture of this section about localization by explaining how this

00:07.580 --> 00:10.970
is configured inside a lot of application.

00:10.970 --> 00:18.890
So open your up peach bee file inside the config folder and scroll but scroll down to the interesting

00:18.890 --> 00:25.820
part which starts at the time zone which you might configure depending on where most of your customers

00:25.880 --> 00:28.910
or visitors to your website are.

00:28.910 --> 00:32.540
So default is UTC it might you might have a different time zone.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.910
So this is where you configure that.

00:34.910 --> 00:42.200
This will be used by the BHP data functions and day time functions and then we go to the interesting

00:42.200 --> 00:45.040
part which is the local parameter.

00:45.230 --> 00:49.490
And this is your local language of your application.

00:49.490 --> 00:53.210
So this is are two character language codes.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.710
Default is e n US English.

00:55.850 --> 01:03.980
You can change is the Spanish or German or Polish or whatever is your language and then additional parameter

01:04.010 --> 01:12.500
is their fallback locale which is the local or language that will be used whenever there is no translation

01:12.530 --> 01:20.180
in the other language so well that also depends what's the main or starting language default language

01:20.210 --> 01:21.570
of your application.

01:21.620 --> 01:28.310
It should be the one that you have your translations initially done in so your page let's say starts

01:28.310 --> 01:31.990
in Spanish so then you only translate to English.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.080
So their fallback should be Spanish.

01:35.150 --> 01:38.840
So let's start with English because that's probably the most common language.

01:38.870 --> 01:41.070
Every one of you knows.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.170
And additionally there is this another setting for the Fake Faker local.

01:46.310 --> 01:53.360
And if you remember the faker is a tool or a library that we used for our database seeder to generate

01:53.360 --> 01:56.780
the names addresses and things like that.

01:57.080 --> 02:04.370
So we can also configure that to be of your local language whether this would be german french spanish

02:04.370 --> 02:06.820
polish whatever that might be.

02:06.980 --> 02:15.600
You can also change that to work with more familiar sounding names and things like that.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.600
So this is about configuration.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.720
Now let's see where are where are all those translations stored.

02:23.720 --> 02:32.300
So you can find them inside the resources long folder and what you initially would have with Lara Lavell

02:32.390 --> 02:40.430
when installing Lara Vale in the first place is the e end folder for English and it consists of the

02:40.430 --> 02:43.100
basic BHP files.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.190
So let's open maybe this validation.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.270
It's the most complicated one.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.860
So those files are pretty straight forward.

02:51.890 --> 02:58.490
There will be also a way to put your translation strings in a J some file will see that in the next

02:58.490 --> 02:59.150
lectures.

02:59.150 --> 03:04.910
Now let's explain what this is how it looks like and what is it for.

03:04.910 --> 03:09.660
So basically you will return an array where the key would be.

03:09.680 --> 03:16.430
Well the key that you will use for translation so you will call that using the translation help or metals

03:16.430 --> 03:18.600
we'll get to that in the next lecture.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.940
But this will be a key.

03:19.940 --> 03:26.360
So what has to be translated a message to be translated and then the value is the actual translation

03:26.360 --> 03:29.850
the text in English Spanish German or whatever.

03:30.410 --> 03:36.780
Additionally it can contain some attributes that you will pass to this translation messages.

03:36.830 --> 03:43.490
So if you need to put some variables like numbers e-mails and stuff you will achieve that by using this

03:44.240 --> 03:49.100
column and the name of the attribute of course I will show you how to do that.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.710
Don't worry about it just yet.

03:51.710 --> 04:00.410
And then you see that for example you have the validation messages of the lot of old validator and they

04:00.410 --> 04:01.730
are all in English.

04:01.940 --> 04:09.800
So to have them have them in Spanish or in German you will just create another folder with the language

04:09.800 --> 04:10.180
code.

04:10.190 --> 04:11.720
So let's do that right now.

04:11.720 --> 04:24.770
So this would be D E and E as for Spanish and then you will create some files and have all those messages

04:24.860 --> 04:32.050
in the language of your choice or any other language that you want to make available for your application.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.610
But we'll get to that in the next lecture.

04:34.610 --> 04:36.560
So don't worry about that.

04:36.620 --> 04:39.710
I will explain everything step by step.
