WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:06.660
At this point this is what you should see so the menu items and everything on the left on the right

00:06.690 --> 00:10.230
and on the top is translated in the desired language.

00:10.230 --> 00:13.950
So currently our default happens to be Spanish.

00:13.950 --> 00:21.570
And in this lecture will add two links to the top menu for authenticated users to view the profile his

00:21.570 --> 00:24.830
own profile of course and editing his own profile.

00:24.840 --> 00:32.160
Also we'll modify the database to store the locale on the User model and then we'll also modify the

00:32.160 --> 00:35.070
forum to choose their preferred language for the user.

00:35.070 --> 00:37.300
So let's go.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.140
So you should have the layout.

00:39.140 --> 00:43.540
Blade beach be open and let's copy those links for simplicity.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.070
They have to go to this ls blog because this is for guests and as indicated users.

00:49.130 --> 00:52.760
And well this ls blog is for people that have logged in

00:55.710 --> 01:04.420
so we need to create a link to the user's profile so it is users show for viewing the user profile.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.500
Now this accepts our parameters.

01:06.500 --> 01:11.370
So this would be inside an array and the parameter name.

01:11.390 --> 01:22.230
If you remember each user we can read the user using the alpha side so our user does method I.D..

01:23.270 --> 01:28.100
Now this is getting too long so let's reformat that a little bit.

01:29.610 --> 01:29.960
Okay.

01:29.970 --> 01:38.350
Now we have to close this array and close the root code and let's add this text to the next line.

01:39.030 --> 01:46.680
Okay now you can copy that again because the second link would be very similar but of course it's not

01:46.770 --> 01:47.850
hard.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.910
This would be a profile.

01:50.910 --> 01:57.560
Now this text is edit profile and the link in this case is not show it is.

01:57.670 --> 02:02.910
Edit And of course it also accepts are user parameters.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.510
So save the changes and now let's see if that works.

02:06.510 --> 02:07.800
So I'm not authenticated.

02:07.800 --> 02:12.180
So let's logging as John Doe.

02:12.180 --> 02:13.620
So I have the spare field.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.470
EDIT added data profile.

02:15.570 --> 02:23.010
Okay so it works now in the editing profile form will need another field but before we added let's first

02:23.010 --> 02:25.050
create a migration for the user.

02:27.060 --> 02:30.030
So let's open the terminal and run.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.160
Peach be artisan.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.580
Make migration add low color to users sorry to users.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.980
Table.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.090
So at this point we can close the layout and terminal.

02:46.090 --> 02:49.340
Now let's locate this brand new migration.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.430
It would be as usual in the same folder.

02:53.740 --> 02:59.070
So we have the scaffold and what we do is table.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.260
Sorry table string.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.330
Because this would be us string column.

03:04.330 --> 03:06.300
Call it local.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.110
And the length.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.300
Well let's give it free characters.

03:09.300 --> 03:19.610
That should be enough and of course finally we do table drop column and column is local.

03:19.610 --> 03:24.430
Now before we run this migration we actually might do with a default.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.420
So default.

03:25.490 --> 03:29.530
Let's say this would be English okay.

03:29.540 --> 03:39.280
Now we can run P2P artisan migrate and well we should have this local column on our users table right

03:39.310 --> 03:40.070
now.

03:40.680 --> 03:48.640
Okay so let's close this migration and proceed with the actual editing of the user profile so this happens

03:48.700 --> 03:51.190
inside the user controller.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.860
So let's open it now.

03:53.950 --> 04:02.020
So this one displays the form so we'll have to add a field so maybe actually let's open this forum OK

04:02.060 --> 04:04.960
so this is this one.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.200
Now what do we have here.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.990
There is the name and well basically the field to upload an image.

04:12.020 --> 04:16.520
So we have to first somehow show what are the languages available.

04:16.790 --> 04:22.190
Now let's define them on the user model so we can add a constant here.

04:22.190 --> 04:26.370
So public const localities look at this.

04:26.370 --> 04:28.600
Yeah makes sense.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.660
OK.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
And what we will do is their language code will be a key.

04:33.920 --> 04:45.840
So E N and then we need a label because we'll use that for forms so English now E as this would actually

04:46.080 --> 04:51.000
well let it be in the in the language.

04:51.130 --> 04:53.020
Well in the actual language.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.120
So it's Espanol for German.

04:57.130 --> 05:03.260
Let it be Deutsche OK.

05:03.440 --> 05:10.580
So now we'll use this public constant that we have defined on the user model inside the form.

05:10.580 --> 05:13.020
So let's add another field.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.580
We can start by just copying this div element

05:21.060 --> 05:22.980
so this would be our language.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.240
And now instead of the input we'll have select.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.750
So this will be a list of options to pick up from.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.820
So this select needs are bootstrap class.

05:34.950 --> 05:44.030
So that is form control and the name would be as the field name so local.

05:44.460 --> 05:54.000
Now to display all these languages we can use that for each directive and we'll iterate over up user

05:55.470 --> 05:58.590
locals as local.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.150
That's the actual key.

06:00.150 --> 06:08.870
So e n e as the E and a label the label to actually display this inside a form.

06:08.880 --> 06:19.440
So end for each and for every element inside this array will display an option with a value that would

06:19.440 --> 06:26.070
be sorry I need to surround that we've currently braces OK.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.970
So this would be local

06:35.240 --> 06:35.480
now.

06:35.480 --> 06:43.330
Close the tag and inside it we'll just echo the label now.

06:43.340 --> 06:47.490
Additionally since this is ah well I select.

06:47.510 --> 06:55.010
So if the user has already selected our preferred language we should somehow display it or select it

06:56.090 --> 07:04.830
so we can do that by checking if the user Loco is different than loco

07:09.050 --> 07:12.190
if it is different than the local that we are currently processing.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.360
We don't do anything.

07:13.400 --> 07:23.840
But otherwise we'll echo select it so that some HDMI attribute that we all echo which will select the

07:23.930 --> 07:30.550
user that actually has the local that was selected so we iterate over each of the locals.

07:30.620 --> 07:38.150
And if the user is actually user local it's actually the same as the one we are iterating over.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.460
Then we'll echo select that.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.220
Okay that's fine.

07:43.220 --> 07:47.690
Now let's check if this actually works.

07:47.930 --> 07:55.100
So it should because we have everyone is now with English by default because we have added English as

07:55.100 --> 07:57.250
the default language.

07:57.260 --> 08:05.560
Now let users now let's add this possibility for the user to actually modify their language.

08:05.900 --> 08:13.560
So this update method has our custom request class which is called update user and lets open it.

08:13.880 --> 08:19.010
So it might make sense to add some validation rules for the language to be chosen.

08:19.010 --> 08:23.250
So no one will post a language that we do not support.

08:23.510 --> 08:27.080
So let's add another one this will be low local.

08:27.680 --> 08:32.600
So another validation rule and now something interesting.

08:32.600 --> 08:39.800
So normally so far we have written those validation rules just as strings but since this time we actually

08:39.800 --> 08:48.110
want to read one of those values from the locals constant on the user model and we actually want only

08:48.110 --> 08:49.750
the keys.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.890
Then we'll have to do that differently.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.050
So how can you do that.

08:53.090 --> 08:59.440
In this cases are you can add an array where the first key would be required.

09:00.580 --> 09:06.180
So we just surround all those validation rules instead of using this character to split them.

09:06.190 --> 09:11.170
We are using an array where every element would be another rule.

09:11.380 --> 09:21.120
So there is this rule class which has an in method and well what this will do is it will check if the

09:21.120 --> 09:32.220
value is in some specific set and our set is actually the user model up user locales.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.100
But since this will actually check for the labels.

09:36.100 --> 09:44.970
So English Espanol Deutsch we actually want the keys and to get the keys we can use that peach B or

09:45.010 --> 09:47.690
A keys.

09:47.690 --> 09:48.330
Function

09:52.540 --> 09:53.790
okay so this would be it.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.060
Now we have the validation rules defined.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.780
Let's go back to the controller.

09:58.780 --> 10:07.130
So this the whole chunk this if statement is only for File Uploading now we should have the request

10:07.220 --> 10:08.720
validated at this point.

10:08.720 --> 10:14.030
So we are certain that someone has submitted a language and that it is valid.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.280
So one of the languages that we support.

10:16.310 --> 10:24.250
So we can just set user local to request get local and user save

10:28.370 --> 10:35.510
now we can also change this message to profile was updated because now we can also change their user

10:35.510 --> 10:40.090
local case so let's refresh that.

10:40.190 --> 10:44.910
And well you see that this user with I.T. one has the English.

10:44.930 --> 10:48.800
So let's now change it to Spanish.

10:48.890 --> 10:55.940
Now it is Spanish if you refer as you can see that the Spanish is selected and then to German and also

10:56.000 --> 10:56.900
there is the German.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.030
So if you log out log in again.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.600
Now we are just verifying that it works.

11:02.630 --> 11:09.200
Let's go to profile editing and you can see German was selected of course the page is still in Spanish

11:09.320 --> 11:12.110
or the default language that you have set.

11:12.110 --> 11:15.820
And this is because we only store this value inside the database.

11:15.830 --> 11:17.370
So that was the first part.

11:17.450 --> 11:23.420
Only in the next lecture we will actually implement this functionality so the user chosen language is

11:23.420 --> 11:26.090
automatically picked up when he logs in.

11:26.180 --> 11:32.630
And also another thing that lets you change the language on the fly depending on the URL you are using

11:32.630 --> 11:33.650
to visit the pages.

11:33.650 --> 11:36.200
So let's do that in the next lecture.
