00:00.480 --> 00:07.230
In the last lecture we talked about where we store the files for our translations we know that there

00:07.230 --> 00:15.600
are in resources long and then the language code and there are the BHP files which consist of a key

00:16.350 --> 00:21.060
that has to be translated and a value which is the actual translation.

00:21.060 --> 00:28.770
So now let's think where we'll store our custom messages for our application so we'll actually create

00:28.770 --> 00:30.300
files form for them.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.620
We can group them by naming those files differently.

00:34.620 --> 00:41.740
So if you do not have much translation creating a file like messages BHP is enough.

00:41.850 --> 00:48.300
This would just be a plain peach B file which will return an array.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.330
So let's return an array.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.810
And now let's take a look at our page.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.040
So for a starter that simply translate this title.

00:58.050 --> 01:07.790
So welcome to Lavell so let's create a first key let's call it welcome and then we create an English

01:07.790 --> 01:16.530
version which is Welcome to lot of all and now let's think what how we will do that in Spanish.

01:16.540 --> 01:26.950
So E as folder and we create the same exact file so messages BHP so they have to be named the same the

01:26.950 --> 01:31.160
version of translations for our different language.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.750
Now let's copy the contents of the original file.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.250
So the key would be the same.

01:36.250 --> 01:41.130
The key is the one you will use to translate.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.360
So now the Spanish version is something like that.

01:45.490 --> 01:47.730
I won't even try to read that.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.780
I have no idea how to do that.

01:51.040 --> 01:59.740
And now let's find our home template home blade BHP what you can see here is just a text inside the

01:59.740 --> 02:01.600
blade template.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.730
Welcome to LA Vo.

02:02.760 --> 02:09.360
It's in English and now to actually translate this to a different language.

02:09.670 --> 02:16.280
What you can do is well first we'll have to of course call something from Lara.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.230
Also it's not that simple.

02:19.780 --> 02:23.980
And now we have basically two possibilities to translate it.

02:24.010 --> 02:31.940
So the first is to use our helper function which is to underscores and a key.

02:31.940 --> 02:34.670
So now let's think how the key should be named.

02:34.670 --> 02:37.610
So we have this file called messages.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.160
So that's the first part of the key.

02:40.430 --> 02:48.650
So messages remember that you will always have to use this as the same as the file is named is the first

02:48.650 --> 02:53.900
part of the key and then inside it is the welcome.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.280
So all of those are on the same level.

02:57.400 --> 03:08.240
So that are the same level inside these messages file so you can use welcome messages welcome and that's

03:08.240 --> 03:08.540
it.

03:09.050 --> 03:15.530
So remember this helper function to underscores is how you will translate.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.470
So that's a very basic example.

03:18.490 --> 03:29.960
Now alternatively what you can also do is you can use the Lang directive here you will also pass messages.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.710
Welcome.

03:31.100 --> 03:39.020
So the key to be translated so it's depending on your choice how you feel better about using either

03:39.020 --> 03:46.450
the directive or just echoing the text and then using this to underscores helper function.

03:46.490 --> 03:52.370
I prefer to use that to underscore underscores myself and we'll use that throughout the rest of this

03:52.370 --> 03:53.060
section.

03:53.540 --> 03:53.840
OK.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.890
Finally let's save the changes.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.710
So first let's refresh the default version.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.160
So now you can see immediately two titles.

04:03.260 --> 04:11.360
So it seems that for English which is our default language it reads correctly that this key should be

04:11.360 --> 04:17.560
translated to welcome to LARRY Oval but now to actually see that in Spanish.

04:17.840 --> 04:25.910
Let's open that up BHP and just for a moment let's change the default language to Spanish.

04:25.930 --> 04:34.240
So E S and now when you refresh the page you will see the text in Spanish.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.330
So of course everything else is now still in English because we haven't translated it.

04:39.490 --> 04:46.870
But notice that also this text when something has changed which is used by car bomb is immediately.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.210
Well it's this carbon library for dates.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.530
This actually picks up the language of your application.

04:53.530 --> 05:01.510
And now this text is also in Spanish but everything else that we just echo as a plain text we do not

05:01.510 --> 05:06.170
use translations is in English.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.970
So now let's also see another example

05:12.220 --> 05:16.570
so let's just call it example with value

05:21.210 --> 05:24.750
and we might have something like Hello name.

05:24.750 --> 05:32.760
So how do we put any variables any additional data that we would like to sum nicely put into that translation

05:37.430 --> 05:40.760
and let's add the same for Spanish

05:43.520 --> 05:47.080
I don't know how is it in Spanish probably Ola.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.120
So let's try it out.

05:49.640 --> 06:01.610
And now inside a paragraph let's verify if that works so underscore to underscores and messages the

06:01.610 --> 06:09.810
key is an example with volume.

06:09.960 --> 06:16.480
And now to pass those parameters you will are the second arguments to this call which would be an array

06:16.840 --> 06:23.630
of arguments that has to match the names of those arguments that you have created here.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.940
So we have a name here.

06:26.200 --> 06:35.590
So we have to pass an array with an element that the key is the name and then some value.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.360
So let's just put some something doesn't really matter what that would be.

06:40.390 --> 06:44.870
So named John and this is how you pass some additional values.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.480
So let's see.

06:46.480 --> 06:56.330
So now the application is in Spanish so we can see all that John if we will change it back to English.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.130
Now it is.

06:57.250 --> 07:02.530
Hello John.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.610
Now let's see another example.

07:04.610 --> 07:07.970
And this would be a more complicated one.

07:07.970 --> 07:17.390
So let's imagine we have a parameter that has that well you should show our singular or plural form

07:17.390 --> 07:19.370
of the text depending on the volume.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.910
So let's say no comments yet.

07:21.980 --> 07:27.480
And then something like one comment two comments et cetera et cetera.

07:27.770 --> 07:35.310
So plural let's create this key plural and then let's see how we should do that.

07:35.330 --> 07:40.230
So this would be a little bit more complicated example.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.770
So first we begin by specifying an exact value.

07:44.780 --> 07:51.700
This is how you specify that for this exact value of the parameter we should display this text.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.180
So exact value would be zero.

07:54.860 --> 07:58.240
And this would be no comments yet.

07:58.580 --> 08:06.020
And then you have to split somehow the different versions for a different value of the parameter.

08:06.020 --> 08:09.660
And you do that using this character.

08:10.260 --> 08:15.380
Now the next version would be for let's say a range.

08:15.600 --> 08:21.450
So let's say when something is from one to two sorry one too.

08:21.490 --> 08:29.890
So you put everything inside square brackets and for the value of the parameter that is from one up

08:29.890 --> 08:42.620
to two you will want to display a text that is let's say comments now then you probably would also like

08:42.620 --> 08:45.890
to say how many comments are there.

08:45.890 --> 08:54.440
So by default you can use that using the count parameter because to actually display this measures you

08:54.440 --> 08:57.710
will have to pass a parameter.

08:57.710 --> 09:04.320
So this will be immediately available as with the name count so.

09:04.350 --> 09:14.260
OK let's see this example now copy it first to the Spanish I don't know how is it in Spanish but let's

09:14.260 --> 09:16.840
use no common Torrijos

09:21.610 --> 09:28.270
something like this sorry for sorry the Spanish guys but well I just have no idea how is it in Spanish.

09:28.270 --> 09:30.840
We are just doing an example.

09:30.910 --> 09:31.200
Okay.

09:31.210 --> 09:34.570
Now how would you call that in your line of old template.

09:35.020 --> 09:36.450
So this is a little bit different.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.100
Not very complicated just different.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.880
Now we also have to echo this.

09:41.890 --> 09:46.950
But instead of using double underscore you have to use trans choice.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.580
So this is a helper function in light of all.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.110
Now you will specify a key as usual.

09:55.150 --> 09:59.810
So this is messages dot plural.

10:00.430 --> 10:06.130
And now you specified the actual value so this would be zero.

10:06.730 --> 10:19.410
So let's do one example with zero then an example with one and with to so we use this parameter.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.520
So then it is being understood in this first segment.

10:23.550 --> 10:26.550
So this is much exact zero.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.310
And this is much exact one 2 up to two.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.180
So say the changes.

10:33.360 --> 10:38.800
And now let's refresh so you can see no comments yet.

10:38.800 --> 10:44.020
This is for the 0 then 1 comments and 2 comments

10:46.780 --> 10:47.710
now.

10:47.890 --> 10:56.450
This is not perfect yet so well for in this example we probably would like to display something differently.

10:56.620 --> 11:02.210
So we used a range here but actually this should also be one.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.570
And then one comment.

11:04.570 --> 11:12.640
But we can also add well many sets unlimited sets of these possibilities and well in most languages

11:12.670 --> 11:17.970
you probably have a value or specific form of text for 0.

11:18.070 --> 11:26.640
Then for one and then for everything plurality you will have the same form so to specify a range from

11:26.640 --> 11:30.110
something up to infinity you will do it like that.

11:30.150 --> 11:40.200
So this would mean from 2 up to infinity and this would be count comments.

11:40.350 --> 11:48.690
Now let's also fixed a Spanish version so here we expect an exact value which is 1 so I hope this is

11:48.690 --> 11:50.640
commentary or in Spanish.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.250
I have no idea.

11:52.260 --> 12:04.540
And then from 2 up to infinity count commentary is so we don't have to change the template just save

12:04.540 --> 12:05.290
the changes.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.620
And now let's see.

12:06.670 --> 12:08.760
So you have no comments yet.

12:08.860 --> 12:16.600
One comment and two comments if we will change it to Spanish This is also correct.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.560
So no comment areas.

12:18.690 --> 12:21.650
One commentary or two commentaries.

12:21.850 --> 12:29.290
So those are the basics of how you would use ad translation helper methods and how to define them how

12:29.290 --> 12:35.370
to parse values and how to use any plural forums now.

12:35.370 --> 12:43.410
Additionally if you would also like to pass a value to those plural text like we have this trans choice

12:44.430 --> 12:45.930
then of course you can do that

12:48.950 --> 12:53.240
so you can call that parameter additional so for short.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.590
Let's just use a

13:00.130 --> 13:01.990
now do the same in Spanish

13:05.480 --> 13:08.120
and just the same way as we did here.

13:08.310 --> 13:16.860
We pass on array where the key has to match their parameter name that we specified inside messages BHP

13:16.860 --> 13:24.730
so this was just an A and then some value whatever that might be let's say one doesn't really matter.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.420
Let's copy it out to all of the examples.

13:27.480 --> 13:33.630
Save the changes and you can see that the now message contains the parameters so whatever that might

13:33.630 --> 13:37.650
be you might pass some email a name a number anything.

13:37.710 --> 13:44.760
So those are the basics of how to basically translate the text using chlorophyll and by specifying the

13:44.780 --> 13:46.860
messages in BHP file.
