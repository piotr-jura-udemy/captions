00:00.590 --> 00:06.420
Now if you find using those keys for the messages that you have to translate a little bit inconvenient

00:06.420 --> 00:13.830
because you can't remember what actually should be shown in this very place where for example you are

00:13.980 --> 00:17.630
using defaults as the messages in your language.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.660
You probably would like to know what this message would actually be.

00:21.660 --> 00:27.630
So when this file messages grows like the example you've seen here in validation you might not really

00:28.020 --> 00:32.070
remember what actually would be the message.

00:32.070 --> 00:39.780
So fortunately there is another way much simpler to story or translations in Lavell and it is to use

00:39.780 --> 00:41.540
J some files.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.050
So how to do that.

00:43.500 --> 00:51.810
So inside your luck folder you will create adjacent file with the short name of the language.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.960
And Jason extension.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.410
So this would have a typical Jason structure.

00:58.410 --> 01:07.760
And now what you can do is the key can be exact text to be translated like Welcome to lot of all and

01:07.770 --> 01:10.980
the value should be the translation in a language

01:14.350 --> 01:17.100
something like this.

01:17.140 --> 01:26.310
Now let's create also this file for Spanish so e as Jason copy the contents from initial English one

01:28.420 --> 01:29.450
and also let's.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.660
Well the language is in Spanish.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.770
So what we have is being a window a lot of El

01:38.750 --> 01:41.160
so let's move this translation to Spanish.

01:41.180 --> 01:41.480
OK.

01:41.480 --> 01:54.440
Now what you can do is you can very simply just use this double underscore and here immediately paste

01:54.440 --> 01:56.480
the text that you want translated.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.690
So this would be welcome to a lot of El

02:05.310 --> 02:08.470
so let's say that we are using Jason here so it will be clear.

02:08.490 --> 02:13.200
Now save the changes and let's take a look.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.050
Using Jason Benny Randle.

02:15.190 --> 02:16.130
A lot of.

02:16.470 --> 02:24.060
So this is in Spanish so that might be much simpler or much clearer to you to keep translations in this

02:24.060 --> 02:31.740
format so you will just put that on the Jason File and the key would be the actual message that would

02:31.740 --> 02:39.510
be that has to be translated and then you can just add this to your files and then it will be translated

02:39.540 --> 02:41.940
to let's say Spanish or German.

02:42.390 --> 02:49.710
And the important thing is that you can keep those files together so you can use the Jason files and

02:49.710 --> 02:51.450
those BHP files together.

02:51.450 --> 02:57.660
So it's up to your preference sometimes when you use some external packages they might force you to

02:57.660 --> 03:00.210
use BHP and store everything.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.970
Ask BHP are raised and that's fine.

03:02.970 --> 03:09.270
You can also keep some messages for example some complicated wear or long messages like messages for

03:09.360 --> 03:11.570
e-mails where you have a lot of text.

03:11.850 --> 03:18.540
You might prefer to just keep them using short key like welcome message in e-mail which might even have

03:18.540 --> 03:25.200
like free paragraphs or something and then for the shorter ones or something that can be put to your

03:25.200 --> 03:29.280
template you can just put that to the Jason File.

03:29.400 --> 03:36.510
Now if you wonder how do you pass any additional parameters using Jason files it's all so simple so

03:36.540 --> 03:44.820
let's add something like Hello name and in English this would be Hello.

03:44.820 --> 03:49.880
Name Now let's move that to Spanish

03:53.000 --> 03:55.050
or LA Ola.

03:55.350 --> 04:01.680
Now mind that if you do not know that in Jason everything is surrounded by this curly braces.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.520
Jason can also have a raise but we won't need them here.

04:05.130 --> 04:10.170
But the text inside Jason fires have to have double quotes.

04:10.170 --> 04:15.310
So if you need to use double quotes in your translation you have to escape it like that.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.780
You cannot use a single pause in Jason.

04:17.790 --> 04:23.910
I know it might be obvious to some of you guys but for others it might not be.

04:23.940 --> 04:29.020
Now let's try this example.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.890
Now how do you pass parameters well exactly the same.

04:31.900 --> 04:39.370
But what we have to do is you have to type the text including the parameters so hello naming this case

04:39.410 --> 04:44.470
and then inside the array you will actually pass the parameter needed.

04:44.530 --> 04:46.930
So let's try it like that

04:50.250 --> 04:55.440
and the second example using Jason and passing the name parameter which you can see here

05:01.830 --> 05:04.910
apparently this didn't work because we are.

05:05.090 --> 05:05.390
Yes.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.250
So the key was wrong in Spanish.

05:07.250 --> 05:11.300
So the key has to be the same as in the original language.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.450
So the one that you will use in templates.

05:13.460 --> 05:17.620
So since I'm using hello here then.

05:17.690 --> 05:23.750
Well of course the key for Spanish has to be in English to only the value is actually in Spanish.

05:23.870 --> 05:29.000
But well if you're a mother a language is Spanish you can also use keys us in Spanish.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.260
That's perfectly fine.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.030
Doesn't have to be in English.

05:32.180 --> 05:34.130
I would say the changes and now it's correct.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.560
So all are built.

05:36.110 --> 05:38.080
So we will use both of those methods.

05:38.110 --> 05:45.010
So we'll also use this BHP files and then we'll also use Jason's for most of our translations.

05:45.170 --> 05:49.690
So let's actually move to the next lecture and do something more interesting.
