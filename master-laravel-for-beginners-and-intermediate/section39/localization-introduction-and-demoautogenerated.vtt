00:00.780 --> 00:08.490
In this section we'll learn about the localization or in other words translating your application into

00:08.520 --> 00:10.640
different languages.

00:10.680 --> 00:17.630
So first let's see a quick demo of what you will achieve at the end of this section.

00:18.510 --> 00:24.780
I will stress that again this is only what you will see after completing this section.

00:24.780 --> 00:31.100
Okay now let's logging as a user that I have set up to have a different language.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.540
So notice what happens.

00:32.550 --> 00:35.190
Everything it is is in English.

00:35.190 --> 00:44.520
Now this person logs in and suddenly everything is in German so the home page is in German.

00:44.550 --> 00:49.350
The blog posts the menu on the top everything on the right.

00:49.350 --> 00:56.010
You can see that there now the texts saying Who are the deposed and when is in German.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.750
Also the tax.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.840
Sorry the days that have passed are in German.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.410
Target is actually a day in German.

01:04.440 --> 01:10.890
Also we have correct a singular and plural forms like free commentator.

01:10.980 --> 01:21.830
Then there is one commentator or aim commentator and also when there are no comments the text is also

01:21.860 --> 01:22.850
in German.

01:23.660 --> 01:32.150
When you go to the blog post The View also everything is in German now I will also add those links to

01:32.150 --> 01:32.770
the profile.

01:32.780 --> 01:41.420
Finally to our menu and to the profile editing for authenticated users what we'll also do is the possibility

01:41.420 --> 01:45.980
for users to change their language and this will be stored for them.

01:45.980 --> 01:51.100
So let's say this guy is actually using German as his language.

01:51.100 --> 02:01.920
So Deutsche Now let's change him to Spanish and immediately you can see the web page is in Spanish so

02:01.920 --> 02:07.670
of course not everything because well let's not waste time to translate every single message.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.620
But let's say almost 90 percent of our page is in Spanish.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.660
And what isn't.

02:14.670 --> 02:20.940
We'll default to English so we'll also know how to work and what happens when you have some missing

02:20.940 --> 02:24.860
translation so you haven't translated everything yet.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.400
So we can also see that it looks like almost correct Spanish.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.010
I have no idea to be our idea to be honest because I don't know Spanish at all.

02:34.110 --> 02:40.650
But anyway this guy now has the page in Spanish when he logs out then you can see the page in English

02:40.680 --> 02:43.330
which is a default language for the session.

02:43.380 --> 02:49.380
If we logging again you can remember that we have saved Spanish as this guy's language.

02:49.710 --> 02:59.050
And then again everything is back in Spanish so what we will actually also see is how to change the

02:59.050 --> 03:06.670
language for the user for the current session and we'll do that in a very neat way using the euro else.

03:07.060 --> 03:12.930
So maybe let's take a look at the blog posts so take a look at the others bar and what you see is a

03:12.930 --> 03:16.150
lot of old dot test slash posts.

03:16.390 --> 03:21.010
So that's the default address that we have set up using larval roots.

03:21.910 --> 03:29.590
But since this course is based on somebody we are using Apache I will also show you how to modify it

03:29.620 --> 03:35.680
so you can do links like this using the language as part of the url.

03:35.890 --> 03:42.950
So E for German slash boats and when you press enter.

03:42.950 --> 03:49.830
Now you can see that the page is in German and also when the user will be clicking other links.

03:49.850 --> 03:54.010
Now his session becomes German.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.370
You can also do that in Spanish.

03:56.560 --> 04:04.150
So now you can see the home page and we are in Spanish so we'll achieve that by creating finally creating

04:04.270 --> 04:11.410
our root middleware that will actually set the user language for the session depending on their request

04:11.440 --> 04:17.510
argument or the language that will be stored inside that database.

04:18.070 --> 04:22.150
As we see here on the user profile of course after you logging.

04:22.990 --> 04:31.090
So this will be remembered for the user and also you will be able to create those great SEO links by

04:31.090 --> 04:39.250
adding our specific language for particular user so he can see the page in the language that he knows.
