00:00.780 --> 00:07.770
In this lecture we will try to translate some parts of our application but will only work with a couple

00:07.770 --> 00:13.910
of simple examples and then those most interesting or complicated ones.

00:13.920 --> 00:20.790
Well basically what we also need for this lecture is older translation files field with the text in

00:20.790 --> 00:22.470
three languages.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.450
Obviously I won't force you to write it down yourself.

00:26.490 --> 00:34.380
There are files available for download under this lecture which will give you the message as BHP files

00:34.380 --> 00:41.700
for free languages English Spanish and German with two entries inside and then the Jason files with

00:41.700 --> 00:44.700
much more entries inside.

00:44.700 --> 00:49.250
So before you continue you actually have to download them.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.950
So let's go ahead and download them under this lecture now or grab them from GitHub the link is also

00:55.950 --> 00:58.530
included.

00:58.530 --> 01:04.740
Now if you have posed the video and downloaded the files that I asked you to download and now if you

01:04.740 --> 01:05.910
will go to the home page.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.630
This is what you will see.

01:07.650 --> 01:14.670
So instead of the translated text you only see the keys for the translation entries like messages welcome

01:14.670 --> 01:19.320
and messages plural here but not start with Jason.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.160
It's different.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.830
So last time we have changed the language the default language to be Spanish.

01:25.470 --> 01:29.210
And using Jason we still see our translator text.

01:29.230 --> 01:38.030
That's not the case with the keys because how that works is if you have something as a key then if the

01:38.250 --> 01:45.420
if this is not found inside messages BHP file then well it will just simply output the key that wasn't

01:45.420 --> 01:46.230
found.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.620
So this makes no sense for us.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.010
It's basically unusable.

01:51.330 --> 01:52.570
But we've Jason.

01:52.590 --> 02:00.120
That's why most of our translations actually are in Jason files if there won't be a translation specific

02:00.120 --> 02:06.870
translation for our given language then it will just show the original key of that translation which

02:06.870 --> 02:13.350
happens to be a text to be displayed anyway but just in the original language in English.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.100
In this case.

02:15.320 --> 02:21.720
So the worst thing that will happen here is that while you will have messages in English if there is

02:21.720 --> 02:29.370
no Spanish translation and with keys well you get keys that are basically not understandable at all

02:29.370 --> 02:32.100
to the users of your website.

02:32.200 --> 02:32.490
OK.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.810
So we have that we explain that.

02:34.830 --> 02:42.570
Now let's go ahead and translate some parts of our application so maybe something simple for a start.

02:42.600 --> 02:50.940
Let's open the layout blade BHP from resources views and will translate some of the things that are

02:50.940 --> 02:53.010
displayed inside their menu.

02:53.730 --> 03:01.230
So since those are actually in Jason what we can do is to double underscore and just echo them us as

03:01.230 --> 03:09.840
the text that we have right now so this should be pretty simple so we do home contact log post

03:15.070 --> 03:16.210
this menu option

03:20.540 --> 03:23.740
and then we can also translate register

03:27.130 --> 03:28.240
the logging button

03:33.730 --> 03:40.110
and well if you are out antiquated we can also translate this one so log out bottom.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.260
Now let's check it out.

03:41.290 --> 03:44.170
So it should be in Spanish.

03:44.170 --> 03:50.710
Now everything else is still in English so let's try to see how we can translate maybe this.

03:50.710 --> 03:58.660
So the amount of comments that should be under blog posts so we remember that this might have even either

03:59.020 --> 04:00.970
singular or plural form.

04:01.030 --> 04:08.500
So the template would be index blade BHP from views posts.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.420
Now there is an interesting example.

04:10.430 --> 04:14.270
So let's take a look at the message just BHP the key comments.

04:14.360 --> 04:18.100
So we actually did it the way that when there are no comments.

04:18.110 --> 04:24.650
This would display our message on the not down no comments yet and then for one comment it will display

04:24.650 --> 04:29.120
something like this and for two and more it will have the plural forum.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.850
So comments.

04:31.250 --> 04:35.090
Now we are using an if statement here and well now we don't have to.

04:35.480 --> 04:40.230
So it's enough to that just called trans choice.

04:40.270 --> 04:43.410
Now the key is messages comments.

04:43.510 --> 04:50.080
And the second argument it doesn't have any more arguments is count and we'll be using this count also

04:50.080 --> 04:52.450
to display how many comments there are.

04:52.450 --> 05:00.070
So if you do not remember that you have to pass the actual number that will be matched against those

05:00.070 --> 05:06.610
rules that you have specified here for the approval plural strings of translations.

05:06.610 --> 05:14.650
And also this argument is available for you to display as a parameter using that column and the Count

05:14.680 --> 05:15.040
Name.

05:15.050 --> 05:18.550
So it is specifically under the name Khalid.

05:19.540 --> 05:27.220
OK so the count of comments is post comments count.

05:27.260 --> 05:36.950
So now we can remove this whole block save the changes and after refreshing you will see that in Spanish.

05:37.090 --> 05:39.220
This is an example with one comment.

05:39.970 --> 05:43.090
And let's also find the one without any comments.

05:43.090 --> 05:48.260
So this is actually in Spanish so works perfectly.

05:48.330 --> 05:53.790
Now the other plural example is how many people are currently reading our blog post.

05:54.720 --> 06:04.030
So we have that under people that reading qui so this would be inside the show blade peach B for posts.

06:04.030 --> 06:11.380
So this one so we display this inside the paragraph using the counter.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.480
So now we can remove this text.

06:15.190 --> 06:19.160
And also use trans choice.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.210
Key is the messages.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.150
People reading.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.960
Let's make sure it's exactly that.

06:25.990 --> 06:32.040
Yes people that reading and then the argument is counter.

06:32.080 --> 06:39.760
So save the changes refresh and it is in Spanish to actually verify that you will need to open an incognito

06:39.760 --> 06:46.950
window so the counter can actually work and you have that correctly so.

06:46.950 --> 06:47.970
OK to Atlanta.

06:47.980 --> 06:52.500
Well whatever that is to people so it works right now.

06:53.450 --> 06:55.870
We covered enough examples already.

06:55.880 --> 07:04.280
So I think it makes no point for me to be translating all of the possible strings here on the video.

07:04.310 --> 07:07.930
So what we will do is we'll live it as it is right now.

07:08.030 --> 07:10.470
Of course I will actually translate this.

07:10.490 --> 07:16.010
So this will be available on the Github so you will just grab that on the next lecture with everything

07:16.130 --> 07:23.570
inside the app translate it but if you wish and maybe that's a good exercise for you you can just do

07:23.570 --> 07:30.470
it yourself so we can translate the whole of the application yourself or even add some missing translations

07:30.480 --> 07:32.120
just play around with it.

07:32.180 --> 07:35.060
If you consider that a good exercise for you.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.550
Feel free to do that in a way if you don't.

07:37.880 --> 07:43.760
Then on the next lecture Be sure to first grab the changes from the gate hub so you will have the whole

07:43.760 --> 07:45.950
of the application translated.
