00:00.330 --> 00:07.050
In this section we'll learn how to send e-mails with lateral and this is actually very very easy.

00:07.050 --> 00:13.020
So let's get straight to the point and first talk about the configuration options and default configuration

00:13.020 --> 00:21.120
for sending emails through Lavell so open their mail BHP file on the conflict folder and let's take

00:21.120 --> 00:21.490
a look.

00:21.990 --> 00:27.520
So the first and the most important setting we need to know about is the male driver.

00:27.630 --> 00:30.930
So this will specify how our e-mails would be sent.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.240
So you can see even here on the comment what drivers are supported.

00:36.300 --> 00:43.820
So there is the SMP P which is basically what you use when you are sending emails using your email account.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.560
Then there is send mail program.

00:45.570 --> 00:51.690
This is a program running on Unix systems and of course there are also cloud options available like

00:51.690 --> 00:59.880
male gun man the real Amazon says spark post and two other options log and array used only for development

00:59.970 --> 01:06.300
which we want to even cover because there are much better options to test sending emails on your development

01:06.300 --> 01:14.240
machine so starting with the drivers setting you can see that most or even all of the options configurable

01:14.240 --> 01:18.580
here are configured using the environment variables.

01:18.650 --> 01:24.800
So on your normal server you will have those environment variables set for your system.

01:24.800 --> 01:31.700
But here on the development machine we have everything inside the DOT and file so you can find those

01:31.700 --> 01:34.990
settings in your dot and file.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.470
Now the default mode driver is the S&amp;P.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.100
This is what we will be using.

01:40.100 --> 01:46.850
We will actually use a service called mail trap where you can send our dummy emails and then see them

01:46.880 --> 01:50.130
like you would in a normal email client.

01:50.150 --> 01:55.010
So there are also more configuration options for example you can configure the host.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.180
This will be the host for your SMP server.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.350
So don't worry about that.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.890
We will configure everything in a moment.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.600
Next option is of course the port.

02:05.600 --> 02:11.550
Now the from option lets you specify the email address and the name of that e-mail.

02:11.570 --> 02:16.490
Others from which all the emails would be sent globally using your application.

02:16.490 --> 02:20.700
So this usually would be your customer facing email.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.810
So for example we have a domain.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.470
A lot of that test.

02:24.470 --> 02:29.550
So this might be something like customer at larval test.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.870
Also the name can be well anything.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.410
Name of your application something that will be sent to the customers.

02:36.430 --> 02:38.230
So they will know where did.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.710
Who did they got got this e-mail from.

02:41.740 --> 02:44.550
Now optional you can specify the mail encryption.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.370
Let's just leave the default option for now.

02:47.450 --> 02:55.190
And then finally there is user name and password which would be used for the SMP server optional you

02:55.190 --> 02:58.310
can also configure a path to the send mail program.

02:58.310 --> 03:02.770
Don't worry about this at all because this is only applicable to Unix systems.

03:02.780 --> 03:06.300
And well we are still in development environment.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.510
We are just learning.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.860
So if you are on Windows you won't even have this.

03:10.870 --> 03:13.060
So don't worry about up.

03:13.370 --> 03:22.310
Now the next options we have is regarding markdown markdown is type of templating system letting you

03:22.370 --> 03:26.970
easily write some text which might also be visual.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.090
If you do not know what markdown is.

03:29.090 --> 03:30.720
Also don't worry about that.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.240
I will mention that later.

03:33.350 --> 03:39.460
And finally there is the log channel which specifies where every event regarding sending the emails

03:39.460 --> 03:40.400
should be logged.

03:40.430 --> 03:48.210
So by default it is logging to whatever was defined in the environment variable may look channel.

03:48.290 --> 03:49.880
Now we've covered the basics.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.110
Now let's go ahead.

03:51.140 --> 03:58.280
Set up a may trap account so we can catch all the e-mails that came out from our application and we

03:58.280 --> 04:00.430
will set this up right now.

04:00.530 --> 04:05.680
And in the next lecture we will be already sending our fairest e-mail.

04:05.720 --> 04:13.640
So obviously I will talk a little bit more about e-mails how to attach files and all related stuff regarding

04:13.700 --> 04:14.150
e-mails.

04:14.150 --> 04:21.650
But I want to get you set up as quickly as possible so we can see how easy it is to send e-mails throughout

04:21.760 --> 04:29.920
the lot of application so after talking about the basics now let's go ahead and visit this link HDP

04:30.010 --> 04:38.120
has male trap dot I O and sign up so you can also use the logging option and I suggest logging using

04:38.120 --> 04:40.070
Google account or the github account.

04:40.070 --> 04:41.600
This would be much faster.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.810
So let me do that.

04:42.890 --> 04:48.170
I will log in using my Google account and this immediately creates an account for me.

04:48.170 --> 04:54.740
So if you have any troubles then you can also sign up and choose any other registering options that

04:54.740 --> 04:56.180
mail drop requires.

04:56.180 --> 04:58.060
It's a free service.

04:58.250 --> 05:04.180
So basically we'll get a demo inbox which will be totally enough for our needs.

05:04.280 --> 05:10.930
Now if you will visit this demo inbox what you see right now is their credentials that we need to set

05:10.940 --> 05:18.830
up our SMP server so everything that we send would be sent directly to this mail trap and we will see

05:18.860 --> 05:22.070
emails on the left well their subjects.

05:22.070 --> 05:27.370
And when you click those email you will then see the preview of what was sent.

05:27.380 --> 05:34.820
So let's go ahead and first copy the host value go to the visual studio code and what we have right

05:34.820 --> 05:41.700
here is the main driver is as MVP by default we might even have SMP Pete may trap yo.

05:41.780 --> 05:48.110
But anyway let's modify that the path is to five to five which is valid.

05:48.110 --> 05:50.840
Then you need to copy your username and password.

05:50.990 --> 05:52.580
So please do not copy mine.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.110
Just use your own

05:57.150 --> 06:01.590
so email password and basically that's enough.

06:01.590 --> 06:09.540
We have the same T.P. server setup and in the next lecture we'll actually see how we create and send

06:09.600 --> 06:17.100
emails in larval and we'll send the first email which would be after someone has posted a comment on

06:17.100 --> 06:21.030
a blog post that I have written so soon the next lecture.
