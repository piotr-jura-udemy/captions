In this lecture and the next one we will learn about another great feature of LA travel which are the

00:06.790 --> 00:12.730
marked down may levels now what you may ask what markdown actually is.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.800
So essentially you can compare markdown to HDMI all.

00:16.890 --> 00:23.430
It is a markup language or markup syntax which lets you style some text.

00:23.430 --> 00:31.440
So the difference between HD AML and the markdown is basically in HD the AML you have the example tax

00:31.770 --> 00:34.870
and markdown syntax is much simpler.

00:34.890 --> 00:43.620
For example you can see how to define R headings with markdown and also you see the HDMI all counterpart.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.370
So this also means that you can compile markdown to an HD Mel.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.000
So let's see more examples.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.330
You can have paragraphs.

00:52.350 --> 00:59.310
Line breaks and also you can check this great page where it gives you a lot of examples so you can see

00:59.760 --> 01:03.870
how to use the markdown syntax to create some elements.

01:03.870 --> 01:12.420
So basically what markdown is it is just another markup language and it's actually a little bit simpler

01:12.660 --> 01:13.900
than HDR Mel.

01:14.190 --> 01:23.280
And then it can be compiled to HDMI all actually if you are a user of GitHub you can see that mostly

01:23.520 --> 01:33.440
or maybe all of the read me files of those GitHub repositories are actually written in markdown syntax.

01:33.450 --> 01:39.070
Now you might think I have HDMI well why do I need another markup language now.

01:39.180 --> 01:45.690
The answer to that might be simple basically markdown has a very straightforward syntax and it can be

01:45.720 --> 01:49.280
easily learned or used by people that are non coders.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.760
Let's say designers.

01:50.760 --> 01:58.160
They might not really know how to use HDMI properly and markdown will just then compile two HDMI out

01:58.200 --> 02:03.570
but will provide also less verbose and simpler syntax.

02:03.570 --> 02:09.780
Now you might think that if someone would have to learn markdown then they can as easily learn HDL.

02:09.900 --> 02:18.030
And this is true but the biggest benefit of using markdown inside lot Mailer eyeballs is that we already

02:18.030 --> 02:21.860
have a set of reusable blade components.

02:21.930 --> 02:27.410
They are already prepared and you can just use them out of the box.

02:27.650 --> 02:31.230
Now the markdown component consists of two parts.

02:31.350 --> 02:35.280
So there are two representations of those components.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.410
The first will be used to render the plaintext.

02:38.430 --> 02:43.140
This is useful for the email clients of the person that you are sending this email to.

02:43.140 --> 02:49.530
That doesn't support or for any reason want to display h the email so this will let you just write an

02:49.530 --> 02:57.390
email that will be sent with a plain text and then there is HDMI all part of those components which

02:57.390 --> 03:05.190
contains some pre-built HD AML with some nice CSF styling that you can even customize and then additionally

03:05.220 --> 03:13.560
is also passing the markdown syntax to output the HDMI URL so it will combine some pre pre added HDMI

03:13.560 --> 03:20.220
all of that components with whatever the markdown is and this markdown will be compiled to h the email

03:20.220 --> 03:21.460
too.

03:21.630 --> 03:28.050
So if this sounds a little bit confusing right now don't worry we'll see an example of that in the next

03:28.050 --> 03:30.900
couple lectures.

03:30.900 --> 03:37.620
So even though rare usability and simplicity of using the markdown may levels won't convince you then

03:37.620 --> 03:39.010
maybe this will do.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.690
It's actually built in in LA well it provides us a lot of stuff that we have out of the box.

03:45.750 --> 03:52.890
It's very easy to use those components to style them and to create your own and then you save yourself

03:52.950 --> 03:57.770
a lot of time creating the same markup for different email templates.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.660
You can make those templates much simpler.

04:00.720 --> 04:07.410
Use the common branding that you have created for your e-mails across all of your different kinds of

04:07.470 --> 04:09.890
emails whatever they are about.

04:10.050 --> 04:16.080
And basically this works great with travel and well the experience should show you that it's always

04:16.080 --> 04:22.220
best to use what Lavell has created for you because this usually just works great.

04:22.920 --> 04:28.250
But that's enough talking because I know that at this point you are probably very confused.

04:28.260 --> 04:34.950
I was talking about some markdown some new kind of syntax and some larval blade components that are

04:35.100 --> 04:36.810
already available.

04:36.810 --> 04:43.510
So probably the best thing to do is now to see an example of how this works how to create those made

04:43.510 --> 04:52.440
labels and immediately see the effect of them and how great and simple they can make your email templates.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.800
So let's see that in the next lecture.
