WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:08.520
Now as usual with travel we can just generate a new mark down my level using the same command as we

00:08.520 --> 00:11.430
did for our previous Malabo class.

00:11.430 --> 00:19.560
So this is speech B artisan make male so our previous class was called comment posted.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.340
So let's call that comment.

00:21.410 --> 00:27.090
Post that markdown just to differentiate it somehow.

00:27.090 --> 00:33.380
Now additionally you can add a markdown parameter which would also generate our view for us.

00:33.690 --> 00:34.960
So let's call it Mark.

00:35.190 --> 00:42.490
Let's call it e-mails dot posts dot comment that mark down.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.960
So now this is created.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.430
Let's first check out the class.

00:46.570 --> 00:53.770
So this class will also extend their main level base class it by default has a constructor generated

00:53.860 --> 00:56.710
and then there is also the built method.

00:56.710 --> 01:02.710
So if you compare that to our comment posted class this is basically no different.

01:02.770 --> 01:07.990
The mark down also has a build method and then it also tries to render something.

01:07.990 --> 01:13.160
But here we call the view method inside our normal may level.

01:13.180 --> 01:20.710
So we just to render some HDR mail from our template and inside there mark down my level you will use

01:20.710 --> 01:27.490
the markdown method to also compile any markdown that might be inside those templates.

01:27.490 --> 01:33.790
So that's the only difference from the class perspective and other than that you can use all the methods

01:33.820 --> 01:40.420
that you have used here in comment post that so you can change the subject attach some files or specify

01:40.600 --> 01:44.560
from whom this email was sent.

01:44.570 --> 01:51.890
So now we know that markdown may class is basically the same as the normal mail class with one exception

01:51.890 --> 01:55.090
that to render the actual contents of the email.

01:55.220 --> 02:02.180
We use the markdown method instead of The View method on a normal may label class.

02:02.180 --> 02:07.670
So let's now check out this template that was generated together with this markdown may level class.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.730
It's common that markdown blade BHP.

02:10.850 --> 02:16.430
Here you can immediately notice what I've mentioned inside the first lecture from the section that this

02:16.440 --> 02:25.710
we will be using some pre-built lateral blade components specifically for rendering the markdown so

02:25.710 --> 02:31.230
if you will take a look at this diagram I've mentioned this at the very beginning that Lovell has a

02:31.230 --> 02:39.390
set of reusable blade components and they are actually part of la vela so you you might see that we

02:39.570 --> 02:41.240
haven't really created them yet.

02:41.250 --> 02:48.270
They are available to us so we can also customize those components and to customize them.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.060
You will have to publish them first.

02:51.970 --> 02:56.430
Now let's stop for a second and explain what publishing is.

02:56.530 --> 03:03.610
So by default as I have said those components are part of Lavell so they exist inside the vendor directory

03:03.670 --> 03:07.280
and are basically part of lateral library.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.950
So if you use them they will just have the default look.

03:11.860 --> 03:16.420
Now if you would like to customize them you have to run a specific command.

03:16.420 --> 03:26.780
So let's run it now BHP artisan vendor publish and you have to add a tag option and use the proper tag

03:26.810 --> 03:30.040
which is Lavell mail.

03:30.590 --> 03:39.320
Now what this did is it copied the directory from the vendor where the larval framework is to your application

03:39.410 --> 03:40.100
views.

03:40.100 --> 03:47.380
So now you can see that there is new folder inside the resources views and it is called vendor.

03:47.470 --> 03:55.190
Now as I've said those templates from the vendor library were copied inside our application to the resources

03:55.190 --> 04:01.190
views vendor mail and then we have two directories the HDMI mail and markdown.

04:01.400 --> 04:09.080
So whatever it is inside HD AML will be used to render HDMI out email but this will also send along

04:09.170 --> 04:11.000
a plain text version.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.090
So for example let's see an example we are using a button here and this is the default slot which will

04:18.230 --> 04:20.920
just this play some text on the bottom.

04:21.140 --> 04:27.980
So first let's check out how does it look like inside markdown which is markdown folder which is supposed

04:27.980 --> 04:29.800
to send a plain text.

04:29.810 --> 04:36.290
So what you can see here is basically a slot which will be this button text and a new URL.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.920
So this is trying to achieve something in the plain text.

04:40.940 --> 04:44.970
Now the other representation is basically HDMI.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.780
So you see some pre build syntax.

04:47.780 --> 04:56.080
There is some HDMI all and then there is also a slot and the URL and actually a call or this is another

04:56.110 --> 04:56.620
attribute.

04:56.620 --> 05:02.430
You can specify it's using the bootstrap styling and everything.

05:02.440 --> 05:06.490
You can also configure we'll get to that later.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.020
Now let's see another example.

05:08.020 --> 05:13.960
So there is the table component which well in this case where we will be sending plaintext will just

05:14.140 --> 05:22.360
output whatever there is because tables are not supported in plaintext at all but actually the corresponding

05:22.630 --> 05:26.660
HDMI component contains a diff class.

05:26.680 --> 05:35.350
We have a table so this is using some HDMI all already but then it will also use this markdown class

05:35.890 --> 05:43.110
which will pass and convert the markdown that was used inside this component and convert it to the H

05:43.120 --> 05:44.300
the AML.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.670
So let's see an example.

05:46.240 --> 05:52.930
So here on this markdown cheat sheet you see an example of how to define our table inside.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.640
Well using the markdown syntax.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.320
So this will be printed as it is in plaintext.

05:59.500 --> 06:07.420
But in h the email this would actually be converted to a normal h the AML table tax and will basically

06:08.170 --> 06:15.060
be properly styled so if you are feeling really confused at this moment.

06:15.100 --> 06:19.140
Now it's time to actually test it out and see how that works.

06:19.150 --> 06:26.000
So inside our template let's write something like hello from mark down.

06:26.140 --> 06:32.770
Now we will also have to check how we actually send this email inside the post comment controller because

06:32.860 --> 06:34.870
currently we are using the comment posted.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.980
So we have to use comment post that mark down.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.260
Now it doesn't accept any arguments yet.

06:41.290 --> 06:45.280
So don't worry about that mind that you have to add an import here.

06:46.190 --> 06:46.450
OK.

06:46.450 --> 06:47.680
Now let's save the changes.

06:47.680 --> 06:52.070
Let's go to the document and write something down like Hello.

06:52.090 --> 06:57.120
Something that is valid and would actually send this email.

06:57.230 --> 07:02.760
Now let's refresh our mail drop inbox and what you see here is what I talked about.

07:02.760 --> 07:11.150
So in this view in HDMI view we see a beautifully rendered HDMI all and this CEO says that is part of

07:11.150 --> 07:14.060
this e-mail that was sent is also configurable.

07:14.060 --> 07:22.970
It's part of the HP e-mail folder where we have our HDMI out templates but what you can also see inside

07:22.970 --> 07:29.550
this text box is basically a plain text version of the same email.

07:29.570 --> 07:33.150
So this comes directly from the markdown directory.

07:33.170 --> 07:40.310
Those are just some versions of this component that will just render plain text for clients that do

07:40.310 --> 07:45.160
not support HD AML or it is disabled in them.

07:45.650 --> 07:48.510
And hero you can see all the components that we have used.

07:48.520 --> 07:54.260
So there is the button there is the text and there is even this hello message.

07:54.260 --> 08:01.640
Now let's also take a look out on how this was actually composed so you can see that what is being used

08:01.640 --> 08:10.750
here is everything is wrapped inside the mail message component so if you will open that you can see

08:10.750 --> 08:14.860
that this actually is wrapped also inside may layout.

08:14.860 --> 08:22.210
So this is just using the mail layout component which contains plenty of HD AML some additional styles

08:22.540 --> 08:24.940
to make those e-mails responsive.

08:25.570 --> 08:30.960
Then everything from the slot is bank passed us mark down and rendered.

08:31.120 --> 08:37.510
So those components actually use each other at least some of them for example inside the message.

08:37.510 --> 08:46.420
You also have their slot for the few footer you are using the footer component which is inside the footer

08:46.420 --> 08:55.140
blade BHP and the corresponding components from the markdown folder basically are structured similarly

08:55.140 --> 09:03.620
early but they will only render the plain text so in this lecture we've learned how those markdown may

09:03.620 --> 09:09.130
levels working general how to customize them where all those fires are how to use them.

09:09.500 --> 09:15.380
But in the next one will actually modified this template we'll use some components and you will also

09:15.380 --> 09:21.890
see how you can customize the styles and everything regarding the markdown may label classes.
