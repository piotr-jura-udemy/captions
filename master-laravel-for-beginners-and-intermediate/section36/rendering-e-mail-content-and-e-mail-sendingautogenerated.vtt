WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.230
So let's pick up where we have left off after the last lecture.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.920
So we know that we can generate this subject.

00:06.930 --> 00:12.480
We know how to say which view should be used for this particular type of e-mail.

00:12.510 --> 00:15.240
Now let's implement this view.

00:15.270 --> 00:22.380
So what you have to know about e-mail sending is that you can't just use any images from your Web site

00:22.410 --> 00:23.280
or styles.

00:23.280 --> 00:28.220
You probably would have to include everything in this email itself.

00:28.680 --> 00:36.370
So this is because most e-mail clients are very restrictive to downloading resources from outside servers.

00:36.420 --> 00:40.890
So it's always best to include everything in the email itself.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.800
Also the HDR mails should be quite limited.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.980
You shouldn't use all the modern features but actually creating HD the e-mail for e-mails is a topic

00:49.980 --> 00:53.760
of on itself and not really part of this course.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.150
But anyway let's try something.

00:56.370 --> 01:03.270
So let's go ahead and add some simple styles so mind that in e-mails you can also use layouts.

01:03.290 --> 01:04.350
So it's not a problem.

01:04.350 --> 01:12.540
You can create a common e-mail layouts that you will use some common branding for all of your e-mails.

01:12.540 --> 01:16.950
Now we are specifying the body because we want to specify the font family.

01:16.950 --> 01:24.360
And we do that not to use that default font but instead we would like to use RTL and Helvetica sans

01:24.360 --> 01:27.390
serif it's a safe font for emails.

01:27.390 --> 01:29.810
Every system should have it.

01:29.820 --> 01:33.710
So what this does is it says used those fonts in order.

01:33.930 --> 01:41.730
If they are available so aerial is available on Windows probably on Unix to Helvetica a typical Mac

01:41.760 --> 01:42.820
OS font.

01:42.900 --> 01:49.230
So you are safe here and it's always better in my opinion on using the default which would be Times

01:49.230 --> 01:49.920
New Roman.

01:49.950 --> 01:58.650
If I remember correctly now we said that everything which is are public property on a Malabo class that

01:58.650 --> 02:05.100
we are using would be available inside this very view which we have for us actually rendering that e-mail.

02:05.640 --> 02:18.350
So let's go ahead and use some of this data so we can say hi comment commendable user name.

02:18.410 --> 02:26.000
So what we are doing here is that each comment has a commendable which in our case we know is a blog

02:26.000 --> 02:26.650
post.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.710
Then each blog post has a user and user has a name attribute.

02:30.740 --> 02:34.830
So we can say hello to the outer of the blog post.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.100
That would be the first paragraph.

02:37.100 --> 02:47.020
The next one would be some one has commented on your blog post.

02:47.070 --> 02:51.630
Now what we can do is we can generate a link to this particular blog post

02:54.330 --> 02:55.440
so let's do that.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.220
We can use a rude helper as we would in any other review.

02:59.310 --> 03:04.890
We know that posts show is a route to display a blog post.

03:04.890 --> 03:11.310
Now we have to specify the blog post The Post parameter which is part of the route and we can also get

03:11.310 --> 03:16.100
that from the comment it is comment commendable Heidi.

03:16.200 --> 03:23.250
So remember the comment about is the entity related in the one too many polymorphic relationship to

03:23.250 --> 03:23.940
a comment.

03:23.970 --> 03:30.000
If you do not remember how this works you have to go back to the one too many polymorphic where we have

03:30.000 --> 03:31.080
defined it.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.480
So this will essentially be a blog post I.D..

03:35.170 --> 03:43.770
Now let's close the array and the root call and inside it we will specify the title.

03:43.830 --> 03:55.070
So that title is command commendable title so it is basically a blog post comment.

03:55.070 --> 03:57.800
Now let's close this paragraph.

03:57.830 --> 04:08.210
We can also add some horizontal line and then let's add a final paragraph to our e-mail and now we'll

04:08.210 --> 04:10.370
say who added this comment.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.960
So another link each graph.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.770
Another route to be generated.

04:17.210 --> 04:22.730
So this is user so this is our route for displaying our user profile.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.880
The parameter there is called user.

04:26.030 --> 04:31.350
And now there is comment each comment has a user relation.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.600
And then there is I.D..

04:34.880 --> 04:43.010
So this is actually extremely simple we can read all the data that we need just for having a comment

04:45.300 --> 04:49.290
now we should also generate the name of the user.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.530
So this is comment comment.

04:53.550 --> 04:57.630
User name.

04:58.600 --> 05:03.730
So we already have plenty of data but let's not leave it like that.

05:03.730 --> 05:09.570
We can also we can also generate what actually was said.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.430
So this was linked like with the user name.

05:12.540 --> 05:17.760
So let's also add said semicolon what he actually has said.

05:19.080 --> 05:25.680
And now finally the sorry not content about comment content.

05:25.710 --> 05:30.480
So we will render the content of the actual comment that was made

05:33.830 --> 05:34.420
now.

05:34.430 --> 05:43.950
The last thing we have to do is we actually have to send this email from somewhere so for now let's

05:43.950 --> 05:44.980
keep it simple.

05:45.030 --> 05:51.180
Of course when we can do that using events that would be preferred preferred way to do that.

05:51.450 --> 05:58.740
And since we will cover e-mail events very deeply in the next upcoming sections for now let's just keep

05:58.740 --> 06:02.230
it simple and do that inside the controller.

06:02.310 --> 06:07.180
So we have a controller for that a very simple one post comment controller.

06:07.230 --> 06:12.220
This is where all the comments to blog posts are added.

06:12.690 --> 06:15.480
So let's see what we are doing here.

06:15.540 --> 06:20.820
We are creating our new comment and immediately relating that to our blog posts.

06:20.820 --> 06:24.780
So what actually actually gets returned is a comment.

06:25.110 --> 06:29.700
So no surprise here the comment is already saved.

06:29.700 --> 06:34.960
Now to send us an email we will use our first save the mail for Sage.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.800
So make sure you add this import

06:41.220 --> 06:44.510
now we should specify to whom this should be sent.

06:44.550 --> 06:53.850
And fortunately we can just specify our user instant instance instead of directly specifying the email

06:53.910 --> 06:54.720
address.

06:54.750 --> 07:02.610
So a lot of it is smart it can understand that and we already have a post and the Post has a user.

07:02.880 --> 07:09.270
So we want to send this email to the outer of the post that someone has commented on his email.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.940
So this is very smart.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.960
Finally there is a send the method and magically what you see it accepts an instance of the Malabo class

07:23.010 --> 07:27.800
and what comment post it happens to be extending is exactly the same.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.670
Then mail level class.

07:30.750 --> 07:37.820
So what we will do right now is we will create a new instance of the sorry.

07:37.830 --> 07:38.570
Not this one.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.700
The comment post that class that we have just created.

07:42.720 --> 07:51.660
Mind that import that was added and since we know that this class has a constructor with one argument

07:51.660 --> 08:00.030
that is required and it is a comment we now can pass our comment variable which we get from calling

08:00.030 --> 08:01.210
post comments.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.490
Create.

08:03.610 --> 08:05.570
So this is magical isn't it.

08:05.590 --> 08:10.680
That's everything that we had to do to actually send an email.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.720
So let's remove this line it's not really needed now.

08:15.730 --> 08:22.060
Important thing to know is that you probably shouldn't be sending emails directly throughout the controller

08:22.780 --> 08:26.000
because this can be done later and well.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.910
Sending email usually is pretty long.

08:29.110 --> 08:32.980
So this can take a couple of seconds even but we'll get to that later.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.090
Now let's just leave it as it is.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.310
Save the changes and let's go to any blog post.

08:39.310 --> 08:43.060
Make sure you are out antiquated and let's write a comment.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.620
Hello.

08:44.710 --> 08:45.900
Writing.

08:47.470 --> 08:48.910
This comment.

08:48.970 --> 08:54.160
To see an email you can write anything that you like here.

08:54.380 --> 09:03.400
I'll just press out comment and something actually went wrong with the route I'm using so it's not post

09:03.400 --> 09:05.190
so it's posts show.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.210
Sorry for that.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.730
Let's fix that.

09:07.900 --> 09:17.310
And just to refresh this so you can see it's already taking a little bit longer to post a comment so

09:17.310 --> 09:23.450
the comment is there but it's not something that interests us what we want to check.

09:23.460 --> 09:28.980
Is the mail drop so you can see we already have this message.

09:28.980 --> 09:36.090
You can check out the subject comment was posted on your and this is the blog post title something in

09:36.090 --> 09:38.700
Latin blog post.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.020
There we have the content which is HDMI.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.600
You can even check the source.

09:42.600 --> 09:50.450
It is exactly how we generate adult but the most interesting part is actually the HDMI out.

09:50.490 --> 09:56.670
Someone has commented on your blog post the title which also has a link we can directly go to this blog

09:56.670 --> 09:58.060
post.

09:58.410 --> 10:06.170
And then there is the John Doe link so you can go to the John Doe profile and exactly what he has said.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.010
So I actually have written this.

10:08.070 --> 10:10.240
Just seconds before.

10:10.440 --> 10:15.480
So this was everything that we needed to actually send an email.

10:15.630 --> 10:19.850
So in the next lecture we'll see much more options that we can deal with.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.440
Emails.

10:20.490 --> 10:22.280
But this is enough for now.

10:22.290 --> 10:27.060
You are actually able to send emails from your larval application.
