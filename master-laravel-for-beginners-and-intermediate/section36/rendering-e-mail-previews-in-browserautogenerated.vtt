Sometimes you might want to see the preview of how the email that would be sent would look like inside

00:07.620 --> 00:08.490
the browser.

00:08.520 --> 00:16.080
For whatever reasons either for debugging purposes or you might even want to add such feature to your

00:16.080 --> 00:22.620
application that someone before they actually send an email let's say in our newsletter or something

00:22.620 --> 00:28.900
that would be read by many people they would like to first see how this email would look like.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.110
So we are the simple end point to our application inside the web.

00:34.110 --> 00:45.780
BHP let's just add our route let's call it May and then closure in inside disclosure we will just simply

00:45.780 --> 00:47.530
read a comment.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.100
The first one so it doesn't really matter which one.

00:50.130 --> 00:59.310
So make sure you have some comments in your database so we fetch this comment model to actually render

00:59.310 --> 00:59.510
it.

00:59.520 --> 01:07.530
And now to render an email preview what you have to do is basically from this route or even a controller

01:07.680 --> 01:12.000
that only depends where you would like to implement that.

01:12.090 --> 01:16.930
You just return a new instance of this Malabo class.

01:17.100 --> 01:23.270
So in our case this would be comment post that mark down so we pass the necessary comment to it.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.400
And basically that's it.

01:25.430 --> 01:26.650
So now we should have.

01:26.660 --> 01:34.820
This may level route so let's copy that and inside our application let let's visit a lot of older tests

01:34.850 --> 01:42.680
less male level and now you can see how the email that would be sent to this user which actually this

01:42.680 --> 01:46.310
comment relates to would look like so we can easily preview that.

01:46.310 --> 01:53.840
Of course you can out much more possibilities you can enable previews for specific things inside your

01:53.840 --> 01:56.630
application you can just protect this route.

01:56.630 --> 02:03.710
So on the other means can see it so we can do plenty of things but generally this how easy it is to

02:03.710 --> 02:07.640
generate a preview of what will be sent inside an email.
