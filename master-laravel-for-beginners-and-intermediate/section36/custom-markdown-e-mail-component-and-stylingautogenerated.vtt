00:00.800 --> 00:07.200
Now let's actually implement this comment posted mark down class and what we will do is we will convert

00:08.430 --> 00:14.390
everything that we have inside our comment posted and this old template to markdown.

00:15.180 --> 00:22.920
So first we need our comments to be passed to this class so we can actually pass some data.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.410
So we'll also do that through constructor.

00:26.460 --> 00:34.120
We will utilize our field inside this constructor and now we also have to add public comment.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.500
So then this will be also available inside the views even though it is marked down.

00:38.510 --> 00:39.470
It's no different.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.870
It works exactly the same.

00:41.870 --> 00:48.620
Now what we are also doing in this class is we are actually creating a specific subject.

00:48.620 --> 00:50.720
So let's also do that here.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.740
We can use exactly the same code.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.930
We can also specify subject using the same method.

00:58.180 --> 01:05.990
So markdown is actually only used to tell it that it should render this e-mail using the markdown templates

01:06.020 --> 01:13.400
not any and a template that you are actually passing here using normal HDMI all without anything else.

01:14.270 --> 01:20.690
So this would be changes to the comment posts that mark down Peach Pit class.

01:20.690 --> 01:25.730
Now let's actually make some changes to the template so let's see what do we have here.

01:26.570 --> 01:27.980
So we have this message.

01:28.100 --> 01:28.760
Hi.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.810
So let's keep it up

01:35.870 --> 01:47.670
the header can be comment was posted on your blog post this can stay the same OK.

01:47.680 --> 01:54.040
Now we can add a text like that someone has posted on your blog post

01:57.790 --> 02:04.780
and then we will actually insert a link to this blog post so we can copy this route.

02:04.780 --> 02:17.200
This would be our new URL parameter of this component like that and here we can say something like view

02:17.200 --> 02:21.720
that block blog post.

02:21.820 --> 02:23.880
Now what else do we have here.

02:23.890 --> 02:30.310
There is a horizontal line we can skip that for now.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.450
Now here we have a link to the user profile.

02:32.480 --> 02:43.610
So let's also add another button component let's call it visit.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.600
This would be the user name profile

02:50.110 --> 02:55.990
so the URL to the profile let's copy that to the URL parameter of the component

03:00.780 --> 03:06.210
also mind we do not need this syntax here so it's just enough to pass it like down.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.790
So let's also remove that from this place

03:12.530 --> 03:13.680
and now the user name

03:16.900 --> 03:20.160
so the button will contain the actual user name.

03:26.440 --> 03:35.590
And finally we have what this user has actually said so we can use another component to display this.

03:35.730 --> 03:47.340
So we do component mail and we use that panel component so male panel and com parliament and inside

03:47.340 --> 03:53.980
it will just render whatever the user has said something like this.

03:54.260 --> 03:54.510
Okay.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.140
This should work.

03:55.150 --> 03:59.520
Now let's save the changes and add another comment.

03:59.530 --> 04:14.570
So hello from Mark down this time it's real OK and I forgot to actually pass this comment object inside

04:14.570 --> 04:15.980
the post comment controller.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.820
So let's weekly fix that.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.910
So this should actually be comment.

04:20.270 --> 04:20.520
OK.

04:20.530 --> 04:22.850
Now save the changes and to refresh

04:27.420 --> 04:30.450
something is wrong with one of the components.

04:30.690 --> 04:38.380
Yes I forgot this character Kay now finally save the changes and refresh.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.230
This will take a couple of seconds.

04:40.230 --> 04:46.230
Now let's refresh the mail drop to see what was actually sent.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.630
So what we have is we have this subject.

04:49.350 --> 04:54.590
So this is as we created that then we have comment was posted on your blog post the header.

04:55.140 --> 05:01.350
We say hello to the user that actually created the blog post and then there is also a link to visit

05:01.350 --> 05:05.820
the blog post and the link to visit their user profile.

05:05.820 --> 05:12.240
The one that has posted that and also a nice panel which displays what was actually said of course we

05:12.240 --> 05:17.010
can style this a little bit more a little bit better use different components.

05:17.010 --> 05:23.330
We can also create our own components like for example in those or regional e-mails that we have sent

05:23.340 --> 05:28.730
using the comment post that template and comment posted may level class.

05:28.740 --> 05:31.760
We just put that image like that.

05:31.770 --> 05:39.750
So it wasn't really styled very nice but you can create your own component here like image the corresponding

05:39.750 --> 05:44.910
one for each the email and plaintext where in plaintext you will just ignore everything because you

05:44.910 --> 05:52.530
can't really display images in plain text and then you can add some nice styling so this would also

05:52.530 --> 06:01.070
contain some of the like user avatar inside this HDMI version of the markdown may level.

06:01.070 --> 06:08.310
Now finally if you would like to style something then there is this famous folder inside the h the AML

06:08.970 --> 06:13.670
and is contained it contains all the basic default HDMI all.

06:13.680 --> 06:19.980
So as you can see since there is a folder for it called themes you can create different themes.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.690
So that's the default one provided by Lavell.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.500
It looks good in my opinion but.

06:25.080 --> 06:33.450
Well you might want to customize it so we can either change it here so modify the classes or alternatively

06:33.540 --> 06:39.400
inside there may be HP config file.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.040
There is a configuration option for markdown saying what theme should be used.

06:45.150 --> 06:51.790
And also there is the resource path where you can configure where you store all the templates.

06:51.810 --> 06:55.530
So as you can see there is views vendor mail.

06:55.860 --> 07:01.650
Now here if you would like some additional theme then you will also create another C assess file and

07:01.650 --> 07:04.740
then you will change the form named let's say dark.
