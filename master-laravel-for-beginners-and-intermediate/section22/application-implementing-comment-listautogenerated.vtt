00:00.660 --> 00:07.950
Now let's take a quick break from Terry and actually implement the view for comments inside an individual

00:07.950 --> 00:14.700
blog post so you can see that we are already displaying the amount of comments under each blog post

00:14.730 --> 00:16.290
on the blog post list.

00:16.740 --> 00:22.560
But when you go into our particular blog post we can't really read those comments.

00:22.830 --> 00:27.840
And we know that we have some because we can see that there are at least six comments for the first

00:27.840 --> 00:31.390
blog post which happens to have ideas of two.

00:31.530 --> 00:37.830
So it will all depend on your actual database and how you insert that this blog post.

00:37.830 --> 00:45.240
So mind that you really have to use the ideas that you have inside the database and you can easily check

00:45.240 --> 00:51.870
that out using BHP my admin or any other client that you are using.

00:51.870 --> 00:56.430
So now let's go back to the Visual Studio code and open the terminal.

00:56.430 --> 00:57.750
You can use the shortcut.

00:57.780 --> 01:02.850
You can see on the screen and let's enlarge it using this button.

01:02.850 --> 01:09.780
So we will run thinker to see if how we wanted to do it actually works.

01:09.780 --> 01:19.990
So we can fetch a blog post with the comments using that with static methods and we specify what relation

01:19.990 --> 01:22.180
do we want and it's comments.

01:22.180 --> 01:31.360
If you remember that the blog post actually has this relation so it's defined here comments and then

01:31.440 --> 01:37.370
let's open the post controller and now let's check out how we actually fetch this blog post.

01:37.370 --> 01:46.400
So in this case we use the find or fail static method which if you remember is trying to fetch a blog

01:46.400 --> 01:50.830
post or any other model using the specified I.D..

01:51.050 --> 01:59.720
But if it won't find this model in the database it will just read the redirect you to the 404 not found

01:59.930 --> 02:03.770
page so we can actually use that.

02:03.800 --> 02:10.700
So we can try to fetch the blog post together with comments so we won't have to make another query when

02:10.700 --> 02:19.220
we will actually be displaying these comments on their blog posts view and call find or fail.

02:19.400 --> 02:26.010
So let's try to fetch a blog post that actually has comments in our case it's blog post with I.T. too

02:26.060 --> 02:29.460
might be different on your machine so check that out.

02:30.110 --> 02:38.940
Find out failed to and voila you can see that we have the blog post fetched and actually it immediately

02:38.940 --> 02:41.220
has fetch the comments relation.

02:41.220 --> 02:45.390
So we have all the comments and it's all done at once.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.420
So we will actually implement that.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.020
So let's modify this show method

02:54.730 --> 03:03.270
so we are fetching the blog post with comments and then using find or fail to actually get it from the

03:03.270 --> 03:05.490
database.

03:05.490 --> 03:13.920
Now let's go to our viewer so views are inside their resources views posts folder specifically for our

03:13.920 --> 03:22.410
posts and we have that inside our show show blade BHP that's our template to display our particular

03:22.410 --> 03:23.740
blog post.

03:23.740 --> 03:32.490
Now let's also take a quick look at the index template where we use this for else directive to iterate

03:32.580 --> 03:38.690
over all the elements from the collection and additionally to display a message.

03:38.850 --> 03:45.780
When it was empty because it might happen that there are no comments yet added for our particular blog

03:45.780 --> 03:48.830
post.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.830
OK so let's start doing that.

03:50.840 --> 03:58.680
So we should probably start with a header saying that there are comments.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.080
Now let's take a look.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.610
If that still works so we have this header

04:05.500 --> 04:14.630
and then we'll use our directive for LS and since we have fetch the comments together with our blog

04:14.630 --> 04:24.260
post we can immediately use comments property which already has the collection preloaded so we use for

04:24.260 --> 04:28.250
each post comments us comment.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.820
And here will echo Holder comments.

04:31.820 --> 04:41.250
But if this would be empty we can echo some additional message like no comments yet

04:45.020 --> 04:46.770
and let's close this using.

04:46.770 --> 04:54.950
And for Ellis now when we actually have some comments we need to display them.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.170
So let's use paragraphs for that

05:03.410 --> 05:08.100
and now this would be very simple since our comment only has content.

05:08.240 --> 05:14.630
Let's display it and we can additionally display that date where this was added.

05:15.500 --> 05:23.270
So comment create it out mind that we are just using the standard time stamps that we get added to all

05:23.270 --> 05:32.270
of our models and now we'll use the same method of the carbon object which is always used as the date

05:32.630 --> 05:42.410
for our models and we'll use this nice diff for humans method to display this as how much time has passed

05:42.410 --> 05:46.130
since that comment was added.

05:46.130 --> 05:51.210
Okay let's save the changes and now see if we can see a list of all the comments.

05:51.230 --> 06:00.000
Refresh this page and we have that so we have a list of all the comments with the content that was added

06:00.000 --> 06:00.380
to it.

06:00.840 --> 06:09.150
So if it if it's not really readable and it doesn't look like it is we can additionally add the date

06:09.270 --> 06:11.390
to a second paragraph.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.210
So let's cut and paste it here.

06:17.800 --> 06:26.910
And since we are already using Bootstrap we can use this class text method which will make this text

06:28.210 --> 06:32.510
Gray.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.570
Now it looks a little bit better.

06:34.930 --> 06:37.990
So now you should be much more readable.

06:37.990 --> 06:41.760
Let's also check other blog posts and yes it is working.

06:42.340 --> 06:48.010
And also for the blog post that do not have any comments yet we get this message.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.630
No comments yet.
