00:00.690 --> 00:08.880
Let's implement destroy action that is responsible for deleting models from the database, so to actually

00:08.880 --> 00:14.050
remove the record from the database table, you need a model instance.

00:15.360 --> 00:25.620
So use the blog post, find or fail method to get the model as we have the I.D. parameter passed to

00:25.620 --> 00:26.150
us.

00:27.060 --> 00:30.630
You just need to call the delete method.

00:33.700 --> 00:42.250
And that table record will be gone forever, Laravel supports so-called soft deletes, allowing to mark

00:42.250 --> 00:46.030
models as deleted without physically deleting them from the database.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.550
This would be talked about later.

00:49.760 --> 00:59.420
Finally, let's tell users their reaction was successful and redirect to the list of posts previously

00:59.420 --> 01:01.730
when we wanted to add a flash message.

01:02.030 --> 01:09.350
We used the request object that was passed to the request method here in the destroy method.

01:09.710 --> 01:12.800
It is not passed, but that's no problem.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.560
There are many ways you can access the current session.

01:16.220 --> 01:20.930
So one of the ways would be to justifying that request object.

01:22.110 --> 01:30.000
As this method parameter and a lot of us will know that it needs to insert the current request object

01:30.000 --> 01:35.580
into this method, that would be one way to access the request and thus the session.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.260
But you don't really have to do it this way.

01:38.760 --> 01:45.960
You can also access the session using the session helper function and the same applies to request.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.900
There also is a request.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.620
Helper function that well, basically does the same thing.

01:55.180 --> 01:59.860
OK, we just need this session, so let's access it using the helper function.

02:00.250 --> 02:09.320
And then Flash said the status message to be blog post was deleted with an exclamation mark.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.420
And finally, let's do a redirect not to the blog post this time us.

02:15.430 --> 02:18.550
We've just deleted it this time.

02:18.580 --> 02:23.860
This would be, to the least of all posts, save the judges.

02:24.190 --> 02:26.500
And now it's time to check it out.

02:28.060 --> 02:34.410
So we are back on our not so beautiful list of blog posts, let me try with the last one.

02:35.540 --> 02:41.390
This seems to work, we have the flash message that we can just click on them and delete them from the

02:41.390 --> 02:42.110
database.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.520
Well, maybe we should also fix the flash message.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.110
It was deleted.

02:50.810 --> 02:54.710
That's the last time when you saw our website looking so ugly.

02:55.770 --> 02:59.610
From the next lecture, we will be working on styling it.
