Rootstocks just returned HTML and don't require any parameters or any extra work, you can simplify

00:09.270 --> 00:11.610
them, for example, those two.

00:13.100 --> 00:18.680
The root class has another static method called view.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.960
It's only job is to render the template you specify as its second parameter.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.660
Under the you are right, you give us the first parameter.

00:40.670 --> 00:41.270
There it is.

00:41.840 --> 00:47.750
Now, this is exactly equivalent of what we have defined in here.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.800
Four simple pages like our home and contact pages, that's a good choice.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.190
So let's refactor those two routes into the simpler ones.

01:01.190 --> 01:04.750
So we now already have the one for the home route.

01:05.510 --> 01:09.750
And now let's also do the one for the home contact route.

01:10.520 --> 01:15.910
Let's provide proper uteri and also add the names.

01:16.610 --> 01:23.360
So first one to the home, second to the contact page.

01:28.290 --> 01:30.420
Now, let's comment about those two roots.

01:34.240 --> 01:40.580
Save the changes and let's switch over to Chrome to make sure those pages still work.

01:41.110 --> 01:47.760
So first, the home page appears to work and the contact page, it all works.

01:48.550 --> 01:52.990
So it's recommended to simplify your roots as much as possible.

01:53.500 --> 02:00.970
If you don't have any extra parameters and don't do any extra work, then just use the route view,

02:01.090 --> 02:03.010
static method to render them.
