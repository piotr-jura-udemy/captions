00:00.760 --> 00:07.360
Let's see how we can pass some additional data to the blade template and then how do you output this

00:07.360 --> 00:11.500
data inside the template for the purpose of this lecture?

00:11.530 --> 00:17.860
Let's define our simple poster that will hold the data we want to pass onto the template.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.860
So this code chunk is available as a download under this lecture.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.590
So download it and paste it inside the root.

00:27.130 --> 00:29.260
It's on the right holding a race.

00:29.710 --> 00:37.510
And unless Iterate also has keys, which we will try to match against the ID root parameter.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.660
Now, let's render the new template we are yet to create

00:49.020 --> 00:53.490
and pass the array containing blog post data for a given ID.

01:01.090 --> 01:04.750
Then let's create the proper template for displaying a blog post.

01:05.230 --> 01:15.730
Again, let's follow the route naming convention and create our posts folder and then show Blade B inside

01:15.730 --> 01:15.970
it.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.440
For the most part, we can copy paste from previously created templates.

01:28.180 --> 01:31.150
The difference here is the section's content.

01:35.470 --> 01:43.900
If you would, take a look at how we have passed the data, every Iraqi defined in the controller becomes

01:43.900 --> 01:47.590
ArpÃ¨ge variable available in the template.

01:50.630 --> 01:57.560
Now, let me coat and of course, you can coat along how we would outpoured past the data and then we

01:57.560 --> 01:59.340
will go through it step by step.

01:59.990 --> 02:04.280
So first, let's have a specific title for this page.

02:04.880 --> 02:11.120
Then I'll add an age one element for a blog, post title and paragraph for the content.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.940
Now, let's use this special syntax first to output the title.

02:19.850 --> 02:23.810
Secondly, to output the content.

02:25.820 --> 02:32.730
Now, the new thing here is the double bass syntax, sometimes also called the mustache.

02:33.470 --> 02:38.600
If you take a closer look, you can see a mustache there between this bracers.

02:38.810 --> 02:43.760
You can put any data or variables that are available in the template.

02:44.420 --> 02:52.730
Since we are passing on the rate, we can access its elements by key using bracket syntax.

02:53.660 --> 03:01.490
It's important to note that everything put through their mustache syntax is passed through HDMI special

03:01.490 --> 03:10.310
char speech function that converts special characters to HDMI entities for security reasons.

03:12.010 --> 03:18.160
You can influence how the data is rendered, though, there is a separate lecture about that.

03:19.450 --> 03:29.170
So let's try it out, go to the browser and visit post one, you should get some output and let's go

03:29.170 --> 03:30.720
visit the second blog post.

03:30.730 --> 03:34.440
It works to also the title is Being Adjusted.

03:35.740 --> 03:43.150
Finally, if you will try out what happens if you provide an invalid ID, you get an error page are

03:43.150 --> 03:44.830
pretty useful error page.

03:44.830 --> 03:49.510
So be sure to look around at what info is available here.

03:53.630 --> 04:01.550
But I don't want to let you go with a code that is unfinished, so let's go back to where you've been

04:01.970 --> 04:07.310
and you can use this handy board E Floraville helper function.

04:08.150 --> 04:13.500
What it does is it can generate an error when a condition is met.

04:14.060 --> 04:19.720
In our case, it's the missing array key for the given I.D. route parameter.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.440
So let's implement it.

04:21.950 --> 04:32.870
So if it's not set posts array with our specific ID, we could return for or for error, which means

04:32.870 --> 04:33.890
not found.

04:36.450 --> 04:42.400
Save the changes, remember this helper function as it is often coming handy.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.140
So let's finally try it out.

04:46.300 --> 04:54.490
Now, let's refresh this page with an invalid I.D. and you can see we are directed to a nice 404 not

04:54.490 --> 04:55.090
found.
