Sometimes your templates also need some logic, for example, only if certain condition is true, you

00:07.530 --> 00:08.950
want to display some content.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.170
This condition might, for example, be that the current user is logged in in Blade.

00:15.180 --> 00:22.470
You can achieve that using directive's if directives reflect the way you would achieve it using plain

00:22.550 --> 00:25.350
ppy if control structure.

00:28.860 --> 00:40.320
First, let's add a new property to our dummy posts array, let's call this property is new and send

00:40.320 --> 00:43.230
it to true for the first block post.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.190
And two falls in the second blog post.

00:53.660 --> 00:58.010
Go to the template responsible for displaying our blog post.

00:59.720 --> 01:05.810
To render content based on a condition, we will use the if directive.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.290
The condition here goes within parenthesis.

01:14.850 --> 01:18.800
So let's check if Post is new is actually true.

01:21.590 --> 01:27.440
The if statement in Blade is closed by a corresponding and if directive.

01:30.520 --> 01:37.150
Now, if the above condition is true, everything inside the directive will be rendered, otherwise

01:37.150 --> 01:37.900
it will not.

01:38.890 --> 01:47.740
So let's add something, our development saying our new blog post using if, say, the changes, and

01:47.740 --> 01:52.090
let's switch back to the browser to verify that this actually works.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.840
Notice I've zoomed in a little bit around four times.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.780
Let's refresh this blog post.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.990
And indeed, we see that this is our new blog post.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.850
Check the second one.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.950
And this text is not present.

02:09.900 --> 02:17.400
For alternative cases, you can use El's if or the ALS directive exactly like you'd be.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.320
Let's try displaying alternative message with Ifirst.

02:23.520 --> 02:31.320
So else if the condition goes inside parenthesis, so let's try the negative post is underscore new

02:32.310 --> 02:40.500
and let's render a message blog post is old using URLs if.

02:42.010 --> 02:48.020
Save the changes and let's go to the browser, so that's a blog post one.

02:48.690 --> 02:52.900
And in the second one, we indeed see the alternative message.

02:55.620 --> 03:02.070
Now, that's a simple case because the Post is new, is actually a Bolian, so we don't really need

03:02.070 --> 03:08.880
as if just showing you that you can use it in other scenarios, maybe in this one.

03:09.060 --> 03:13.070
Actually, the better way is to just add an alert directive.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.450
So just the opposite case.

03:19.590 --> 03:25.320
Say the changes again and let's verify that it still works.
