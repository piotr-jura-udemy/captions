Blade comes with other useful directives for conditional rendering.

00:06.680 --> 00:17.450
Let's try that unless directive, it will render the content only if its condition is false and it has

00:17.450 --> 00:28.810
no alternative or else options, it has to be closed with one and unless directive so lets other condition

00:28.830 --> 00:31.470
this can be posed is new.

00:32.540 --> 00:41.510
So if this condition will be false, the content will be rendered so we can put something like it is

00:41.510 --> 00:48.920
an old post using unless safety changes.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.700
And let's head to the chrome to verify it at first.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.650
Let's try with blog post one.

00:55.550 --> 01:02.630
It's not rendered because this is our new blog post and here it is, unless it's working.

01:05.770 --> 01:09.430
Next, there are the ESET and empty directives.

01:10.210 --> 01:15.250
They work exactly the same as their counterparts functions.

01:17.520 --> 01:26.280
But first, let's add that his comments property to one of our posts, maybe to the first one, so his

01:26.280 --> 01:28.170
comments equals true.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.060
So we want added to the second blog post.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.540
Now let's go back to the template.

01:38.910 --> 01:44.550
So below the content, let's use that is, said DirecTV.

01:45.880 --> 01:54.190
Which adds with our counterpart and is set to verify if the variable is actually set.

01:55.970 --> 02:07.970
So we'll check if Post has comments is set and we will render that the Post has some comments using

02:07.970 --> 02:08.600
it said.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.450
So let's verify that in the browser.

02:16.990 --> 02:24.700
That's the first blog post, and you can see that the Post has some comments, text is rendered and

02:24.700 --> 02:30.490
on the second blog post, there is no text as this property does not exist.

02:34.970 --> 02:38.330
Now, let's glance at the blade dogs.

02:40.050 --> 02:46.710
So you can see there's plenty more of this conditional rendering directives, most of them are combined

02:46.710 --> 02:53.290
with Laravel features you are yet to learn about, so you will see them much later in the course.

02:54.180 --> 03:00.270
So we want to use at all, if you are curious, go take a look at what's possible.

03:03.820 --> 03:12.160
Finally, you might be happy to learn that you can create your own custom if statements in late and

03:12.160 --> 03:14.440
the recent accommodation page about it.

03:15.010 --> 03:22.090
So whenever you feel like you are ready to do it and you will find some usage for it, I invite you

03:22.090 --> 03:24.610
to just try it out on yourself.
