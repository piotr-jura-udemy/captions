00:01.720 --> 00:11.020
When you use Parshall's in loops specifically, you can use the each directive instead of loop directive

00:11.020 --> 00:17.380
combined with include that each DirecTV has four arguments.

00:18.340 --> 00:21.640
First is the partial template name.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.780
Second, their collection to render.

00:29.150 --> 00:39.170
First, the name of the iteration variable made available in the partial template that's posed in our

00:39.170 --> 00:47.250
case for optional is the partial template name to render when the collection is empty.

00:48.050 --> 00:54.380
So it's like an equivalent of empty in the four hours directive.

00:56.370 --> 00:58.770
With each directive, however.

01:00.360 --> 01:08.460
The partial template does not inherit any variables from the current context in our case.

01:12.120 --> 01:20.130
The loop variable is not available to make this example work, we would need to temporarily comment

01:20.130 --> 01:23.490
out the code that depends on the low preferrable.

01:24.550 --> 01:31.470
But first, let's comb it out for ourselves and let's see how it goes.

01:33.550 --> 01:43.690
So refreshing, you can see an error, there is an undefined variable loop and, well, exactly, that's

01:43.690 --> 01:51.310
the problem because it's not being inherited as it would be when you use to include directive.

01:52.520 --> 02:01.790
So if we just comment out the code, depending on it, and just leave this template to be as simple

02:01.790 --> 02:04.700
as this, rendering the title.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.530
It actually would work.

02:14.850 --> 02:21.930
So you should know that there is a shorthand alternative to render a collection using partials that

02:21.960 --> 02:30.420
each directive but beware if you need to partial to inherit the variables, stick to the other directives

02:30.420 --> 02:32.580
combined with include.

02:36.830 --> 02:44.570
Let's bring back the code to the previous state, as I just wanted to show you this each directive,

02:44.570 --> 02:48.410
but we will stick to four else for this example.
