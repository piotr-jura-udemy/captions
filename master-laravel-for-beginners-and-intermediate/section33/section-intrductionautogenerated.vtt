In the whole last section we've learned how to manage files and specifically uploading files inside

00:07.380 --> 00:09.420
your of applications.

00:09.420 --> 00:18.130
So you were able to add a blog post with an image that was easily uploaded by selecting a file to upload

00:18.200 --> 00:26.060
and then it created a new row inside the images table which contained a path to an image and a blog

00:26.060 --> 00:27.140
post I.D..

00:27.890 --> 00:35.660
So in this section what we will try to achieve and learn is to be able to also show our user profile

00:35.660 --> 00:43.110
page which this user can also edit his own avatar by uploading our file.

00:43.190 --> 00:51.590
So before we actually achieve that we obviously have to create logic for uploading this avatar of the

00:51.590 --> 00:52.460
user.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.420
But this is not our goal.

00:54.470 --> 01:04.490
What we want to learn is how to create a relationship in light eloquent called polymorphic relationships.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.470
Now we'll start with the simplest one.

01:07.550 --> 01:17.310
So polymorphic 1 to 1 and to say that in simplest terms what is a poly for poly morphemes relationship.

01:17.570 --> 01:27.080
It is a relationship where on one side you will have an image table but this table won't be only limited

01:27.080 --> 01:35.900
to blog posts but instead you would be able to use the same table to store the images both for blog

01:35.900 --> 01:39.200
posts and for the users.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.500
So this won't have a blog post a day column anymore.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.560
This would be something else.

01:45.560 --> 01:53.810
So before we get to the actual polymorphic one to one relationship we have to quickly implement the

01:53.810 --> 02:02.350
logic for showing a user profile and modifying the user profile which means adding an avatar.

02:02.390 --> 02:07.860
So let's go ahead and see how quickly can we do it inside Lara.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.920
Well at this point when we have learned all the basics required.
