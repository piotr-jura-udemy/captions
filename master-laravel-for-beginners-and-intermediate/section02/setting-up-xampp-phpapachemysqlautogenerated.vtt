This lecture is only for Windows users, if you are not on Windows, please skip this lecture and skip

00:08.250 --> 00:12.370
all other lectures not related to the Windows operating system.

00:13.350 --> 00:21.180
We will learn how to install and configure some package, which is a bundle of Apache Web server, BHP

00:21.480 --> 00:23.220
and MySQL database.

00:24.360 --> 00:32.700
The first step is to download Zamp, visit the website, and on the main page, you should see the download

00:32.700 --> 00:33.960
link for Windows.

00:34.260 --> 00:34.830
Click it.

00:37.630 --> 00:40.960
When the file is downloaded, run the installer.

00:46.110 --> 00:52.940
You might be worried about the user account control, please follow the suggestion and don't insult

00:53.010 --> 00:56.460
Zamp to any other folder than the default proposed.

01:01.380 --> 01:04.560
From the components, we only need Apache.

01:05.940 --> 01:14.730
My school, BHP and Poppy, my admin rest can be unchecked unless, you know, you will need them.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.020
Please install to this default folder.

01:23.850 --> 01:30.220
Now wait for the installation process to complete, it might take a couple of minutes, so please post

01:30.220 --> 01:34.770
the video right now and resume when your installation is complete.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.760
You will be asked to start the control panel, please.

01:46.810 --> 01:49.680
Unchecked option and press finish.

01:51.470 --> 02:00.170
Now, let's run the control panel of some manually, but as an administrator on the start menu type.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.720
And press run as an administrator.

02:18.050 --> 02:23.810
If you don't run Zamp as an administrator, you might have filed permission issues.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.740
Now, start today, Apache and.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.350
MySQL server.

02:39.040 --> 02:47.800
By pressing start buttons next to them, both Apache and Maisky labels should be green, and when visiting

02:49.250 --> 02:59.680
twenty seven oh one in the browser, you should see the example dashboard if Apache did not start.

03:00.960 --> 03:09.900
It might mean the port is blocked, Skype is known for using this port in case officers make sure to

03:09.900 --> 03:11.670
stop the Skype first.
