Then Ron B, Dash V to check the version number of BHP, and if it works at all, you should see output

02:19.220 --> 02:26.930
similar to mine and also make sure the version you see matches the one you've downloaded, because sometimes

people have previously installed BHP and might have some older versions dangling, which might potentially

02:33.740 --> 02:34.700
cause issues.
