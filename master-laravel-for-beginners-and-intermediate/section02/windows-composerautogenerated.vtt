Composer is a tool to manage your project dependencies, for example, the lateral framework is the

00:08.130 --> 00:09.570
dependency of your project.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.730
But Laravel also depends on some other third party libraries.

00:14.730 --> 00:17.250
And to install them, it uses composer.

00:18.520 --> 00:24.520
You would like to install composer globally, not only you would be able to manage a specific project

00:24.520 --> 00:30.320
dependencies, additionally, you will be able to create new projects using it.

00:31.060 --> 00:34.540
Fortunately, that's easy on Windows.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.830
Go to the Windows installation instructions.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.580
And download the composer installer and run it.

01:02.190 --> 01:09.570
You might be asked to point to the binary, make sure you point to the example one we've just installed,

01:10.080 --> 01:14.120
if you've never installed BHB before, that should be the default choice.

01:14.130 --> 01:19.110
Anyway, keep confirming with next until done.

01:24.330 --> 01:29.310
Then restart the terminal application if it is running.

01:34.560 --> 01:43.470
Finally, inside the terminal type composer dash uppercase V, that's important, it has to be upper

01:43.470 --> 01:51.120
case and you should see the composer version, which also proves it's installed correctly and works

01:51.120 --> 01:51.720
globally.
