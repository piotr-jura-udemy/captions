One of the best Laravel practices is to use their resource controllers, most web applications consist

00:09.540 --> 00:14.160
of crude actions around different resources.

00:15.160 --> 00:24.760
Let's take a look at what crude is it stands for create, read, update and delete.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.450
Indeed, most of the time, this is what Web applications are all about, you create resources like

00:37.450 --> 00:44.200
blog posts, you list them, you display one blog post.

00:45.480 --> 00:56.250
But you also can edit a post and delete it additionally for creating and editing, you need to display

00:56.280 --> 00:58.220
some kind of forum.

00:59.340 --> 01:05.470
The resource controller creates all necessary routes and controller actions for you.

01:06.030 --> 01:10.380
Everything is made according to best practices and conventions.

01:11.340 --> 01:16.350
The following diagram will help you understand what routes will be created.

01:16.350 --> 01:19.230
For example, posts a resource.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.940
What would be the route names you are eyes and what is their function.

01:25.470 --> 01:29.220
