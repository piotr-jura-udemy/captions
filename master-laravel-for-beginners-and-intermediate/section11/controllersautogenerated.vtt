WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:06.430
So far, you've seen we have put all the code inside a single Web file.

00:07.200 --> 00:14.070
While that might work for really tiny applications, it might have crossed your mind that there has

00:14.070 --> 00:17.010
to be a better way to organize and keep to code.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.280
And there is a better way.

00:19.330 --> 00:21.940
It's called Control Our Classes.

00:22.900 --> 00:29.890
These classes are kept inside their up HTP controllers folder.

00:31.660 --> 00:40.090
Let's create our own controller first opened the terminal, we will call this new controller, home

00:40.090 --> 00:49.720
controller for this run, be artisan, make call on controller, home controller.

00:51.980 --> 00:55.680
Take a look at the new class generated for us.

00:56.240 --> 01:07.130
It's empty now, but you should notice that it extends the controller class, which already existed

01:07.310 --> 01:10.160
there in the controllers folder before.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.990
It's a base class for all of your controllers.

01:14.690 --> 01:22.130
Make sure to extend it as it gives your controllers some convenience methods, like, for example,

01:22.280 --> 01:28.270
the middleware method to apply middleware to controller actions.

01:29.300 --> 01:36.050
You should understand that controller classes are not the alternative to routes your application always

01:36.050 --> 01:37.190
needs routine.

01:37.550 --> 01:46.160
Controller classes can replace the closures in rooting files instead of defining their logic right after

01:46.160 --> 01:47.270
you define roots.

01:47.300 --> 01:54.960
Now you tell a lot of a routine to call aspecific action for a root and action.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.180
So this is a new term for us.

01:58.670 --> 02:03.860
And action is a controller method bound to a root.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.950
To have the first hand understanding.

02:07.250 --> 02:13.910
We will move the homepage and the contact page to our new controller.

02:17.020 --> 02:29.590
Let's ask two methods in home control over their home methods and another one, the contact methods.

02:32.330 --> 02:33.770
They will return.

02:36.370 --> 02:40.180
The view function with the template name.

02:48.200 --> 02:55.460
Now we need to tell Laravel Rueter how to root to this controller actions, so we need to go back to

02:55.460 --> 03:04.850
webapp file and change those two routes so we will change back to using the get method instead of the

03:04.850 --> 03:05.810
view method.

03:06.290 --> 03:15.140
And since they are not simply view routes, instead of providing the template, name or anonymous function,

03:15.650 --> 03:21.860
you provide an array where first element is the controller class name.

03:24.090 --> 03:33.930
You can use their controller class constant to get that name, and the second argument is the action

03:33.930 --> 03:37.770
name, meaning the method name in that class.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.980
In our case, that's home.

03:41.760 --> 03:50.070
Let's copy this over for the second action, the contact page, and just change the action name to be

03:50.070 --> 03:55.590
contact and finally let to reformat that back.

03:57.060 --> 04:04.380
Now, since this whole controller class is actually defined in certain namespace, which is defined

04:04.380 --> 04:05.340
as such.

04:06.600 --> 04:13.500
You can't just use this class name like that, you need to add a new statement for it, and this was

04:13.950 --> 04:17.850
automatically done for me by visual studio code plugins.

04:18.420 --> 04:24.060
If you don't have such plugins or you're using something else, make sure to artist use statement at

04:24.060 --> 04:24.600
the top.

04:28.090 --> 04:35.320
Now opened the terminal and run ppy artisan route least.

04:39.130 --> 04:47.830
To see that our changed routes now reflect that they are controller based, so take a look at this line

04:48.430 --> 04:52.060
that the action is now our controller class action.

04:53.110 --> 04:59.080
Also the contact page is our controller class action.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.790
Finally, you can also verify in the browser that this would still work.
