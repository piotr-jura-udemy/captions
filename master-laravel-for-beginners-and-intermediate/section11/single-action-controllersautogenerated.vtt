00:00.730 --> 00:07.780
While controller classes are great for grouping related logic using actions, you can also create a

00:07.780 --> 00:13.250
controller for a single action to create a single action controller.

00:13.270 --> 00:18.400
You just add the method, underscore, underscore, invoked to it.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.170
It would be the only action of the controller.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.540
Let's make an example about controller.

00:26.110 --> 00:33.460
So Ron Partisan make controller about controller.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.050
Now let's open this up.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.310
Let's add the invoke methods.

00:45.830 --> 00:50.810
And just returned the text single from it.

00:57.620 --> 01:04.550
Now, the route is defined similar to how you would point to a controller class action, though, you

01:04.550 --> 01:07.210
just need to give the class name.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.190
So route get.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.580
Let's do this under the single year I.

01:15.740 --> 01:25.690
And now the class name, which is about controller and we are using the class constant defined in all

01:25.700 --> 01:30.770
PE classes, also make sure to add this you statement.

01:31.280 --> 01:39.410
Remember that with controller class that had many actions, you had to provide an array with class name

01:39.410 --> 01:43.300
and action name in single action controllers.

01:43.310 --> 01:46.620
It's enough to just provide their class name.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.740
Finally, let's verify this route.

01:51.110 --> 01:55.850
So let's go to the euro single and there it is, the text single.
