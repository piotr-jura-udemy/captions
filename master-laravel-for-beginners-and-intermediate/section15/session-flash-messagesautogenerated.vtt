You already know Laravel uses a session to give validation errors on forms submission for the next pages.

00:09.030 --> 00:17.280
You can also use this session for keeping short messages between pages, also called flush messages.

00:18.030 --> 00:26.400
Flash messages are called so as they are one time messages, they are created, displayed once and then

00:26.400 --> 00:35.600
immediately deleted using request variable session method flash.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.130
You can store a message under a specific name like status.

00:41.700 --> 00:47.250
And for this case the message can be the blog post was created.

00:50.830 --> 00:57.430
Scenes flash messages are not really page specific, you can render them in the layout.

01:01.460 --> 01:05.330
Reading them is like reading validation errors in Blady.

01:06.930 --> 01:13.710
Calling the session function with the expected variable name will help us check if it is defined at

01:13.710 --> 01:19.800
all so we can do if session status.

01:23.090 --> 01:36.140
Then let's add a development with some styling like red background and white text so we can clearly

01:36.170 --> 01:37.690
see the message.

01:42.550 --> 01:52.120
And finally rendered a flash message using the session call again with their status as we want to read

01:52.120 --> 01:54.460
a variable called status from the session.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.440
Safe, Cengiz.

01:58.020 --> 02:01.980
And let's go to the forum and try to send it with the correct input.

02:03.480 --> 02:11.910
There it is, our session message, if I would refresh this page to flush message disappears as it is

02:11.910 --> 02:13.860
deleted from the session.
