00:02.760 --> 00:11.370
Thanks to the middle, where cold share errors from session, the errors flashed through the session

00:11.370 --> 00:18.600
when validation fails are always available as the errors variable in blade templates.

00:19.750 --> 00:28.930
Let's open the create blade template to display all arrows from the form first, you can check if there

00:28.960 --> 00:35.130
are any errors using the IV directive and the object inside the arrows variable.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.310
Any methods?

00:44.350 --> 00:49.600
That area was variable, is an object of the message, but class.

00:51.430 --> 00:59.320
Let's add some mark-up inside, starting with UNDEF element and on Unordered, at least now the old

00:59.320 --> 01:09.340
method gives a list of errors that you can iterate over so you can use for each and iterate over errors,

01:10.060 --> 01:22.480
all using the error variable and then close that for each loop, then just output error variable to

01:22.480 --> 01:26.590
show users the actual error messages.

01:31.630 --> 01:36.050
Let's switch over to the browser to see if the area reporting works.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.610
Try sending an empty form.

01:39.220 --> 01:46.110
The errors are visible and as a reminder, when validation fails, redirect is made to the last page.

01:46.480 --> 01:52.180
In our case, the page with the form and the session contains the errors variable.

01:55.650 --> 02:03.150
This was good to display all errors that happened, if you want to display field specific errors close

02:03.150 --> 02:07.380
to their related field, you can use that error directive.

02:11.800 --> 02:19.450
Code around the error directive will only render when the reason there are for a specific property.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.560
Then you can print it using the special message variable.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.340
So let's see this in action.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.870
There it is, are title specific error.
