Let's see the simplest way to store data sent through a form, it is possible that if you would give

00:10.830 --> 00:18.840
it a little bit of effort, you will be able to write the code yourself as everything you need was already

00:18.840 --> 00:19.410
covered.

00:20.490 --> 00:27.010
First, to store the data, we need to create its model instance.

00:27.660 --> 00:34.620
So let's make a new blog post model.

00:38.510 --> 00:42.150
And assign it to the post variable.

00:42.800 --> 00:50.360
Also, make sure that inside this post controller class, you are importing this model.

00:56.280 --> 01:05.080
Now assigned to the title and content properties, reading input, using the request object input method.

01:08.160 --> 01:14.790
So first the title we have to request object passed as a parameter.

01:15.120 --> 01:22.570
We can use the input method to get the title and we will do the same with the content.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.390
So request input content.

01:30.570 --> 01:39.990
Then let's call the save method on the model object to start the new record in the database.

01:41.480 --> 01:50.540
Now you have a choice whether to show the user the success message or redirect to another page, usually

01:50.540 --> 01:52.640
the redirect is the better option.

01:53.060 --> 02:00.100
You can either redirect back to the list of posts or to the newly created post page.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.380
So let's redirect to the blog post page.

02:05.060 --> 02:12.900
You should also know how to do it in the redirect responses lecture you've learned.

02:12.920 --> 02:21.140
You need to return the result of the call to redirect object.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.010
Route method.

02:25.690 --> 02:36.280
And then the root name now, after you saved a model, it's idee, property gets assigned so you can

02:36.280 --> 02:39.250
pass it to the root method.

02:43.460 --> 02:50.390
The parameter name for this route is post, and we pass the post I.D. to it.

02:52.370 --> 03:01.190
OK, now let's verify how this works once again, so go to the forum page and type some input.

03:01.430 --> 03:06.800
Doesn't really matter what and press create, make sure your database is running.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.540
And there it is.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.310
Everything is as expected.

03:10.850 --> 03:16.310
After sending the data, you are being redirected to the new post page.

03:17.730 --> 03:24.830
Just need to make sure to fill out the inputs, because validating data is a topic of another lecture.

03:25.500 --> 03:30.740
As a final note, that's not the one and only way to store new models.

03:31.230 --> 03:34.760
We will see different options throughout the course.
