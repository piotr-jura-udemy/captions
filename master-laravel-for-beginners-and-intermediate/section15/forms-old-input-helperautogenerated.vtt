It might be a very useful feature to keep the input entered by the user if the validations failed,

00:09.150 --> 00:13.780
especially if the forms are larger and contain more fields.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.390
Let me show you what I mean.

00:17.170 --> 00:20.350
Send this forum with the incorrect input.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.980
And apart from seeing the errors, you can see the input is gone.

00:25.810 --> 00:27.340
You need to retype it again.

00:27.940 --> 00:34.090
It's fine when you have two fields, but not so fine if you have 10 or 20 fields.

00:34.990 --> 00:43.240
Laravel will keep the so-called old input in the session for you and you can retrieve it using the global

00:43.240 --> 00:46.110
old helper function in blade templates.

00:46.630 --> 00:55.990
All you have to do is to set the value of the input to a call to an old function with the name of that

00:55.990 --> 00:56.550
field.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.180
So title in this case.

00:58.750 --> 01:05.590
Alternatively, it accepts a second optional argument with a default value, and we will use that later.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.100
Let's do the same with the text area.

01:10.510 --> 01:13.330
So we called with content.

01:19.010 --> 01:26.360
Next time you will submit the form with the incorrect input, the input will stay in the form so we

01:26.360 --> 01:27.110
can fix it.
