00:00.450 --> 00:04.320
In the last lecture we finished doing the logging forum.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.100
But we can't test it yet.

00:06.120 --> 00:12.300
Of course if you are following me pretty quickly and your session is still active.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.750
After we have registered.

00:13.770 --> 00:20.960
Then when you will go to the logging page you should be also redirected back to this home page us.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.260
You are currently signed in.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.210
At least I am now.

00:25.380 --> 00:33.570
Let's see how we can display some links or some content to the user depending if they are authenticated

00:33.660 --> 00:34.290
or not.

00:35.010 --> 00:38.790
And we'll do that inside our layout.

00:39.060 --> 00:43.740
So let's close all these files and go to the layout.

00:43.740 --> 00:52.170
Blade peach P so you can see that we already are displaying something depending or session for example

00:52.470 --> 00:59.790
like this status messages when something happens and here on the top are our links for example to blog

00:59.790 --> 01:06.910
posts and at home and contact pages so we'll be modifying it here first maybe let's change this are

01:06.930 --> 01:12.220
the blog posts to just out now.

01:12.630 --> 01:21.720
There is another directive in Lavell called guest so this allows us to display something for guests

01:23.270 --> 01:30.220
and it also has an else statement so we can display something for authenticated users.

01:30.380 --> 01:38.800
And you have to close it with and guest so let's see if that works.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.870
So far.

01:39.880 --> 01:45.080
Guest will display guest and for everyone else Hello.

01:45.180 --> 01:49.890
User so save the changes and let's refresh the page.

01:49.890 --> 01:56.200
So depending on if your authenticated session is still active you should see something.

01:56.490 --> 02:03.150
I am seeing Hello user because I have registered and I am still logged in.

02:03.150 --> 02:11.490
So now that we know how we can conditionally display something for the users we can display some additional

02:11.580 --> 02:14.110
links for them.

02:14.310 --> 02:23.610
So first when the user is not authenticated what we would like to show them is probably the link to

02:23.640 --> 02:26.310
register and logging.

02:27.450 --> 02:30.270
So let's copy one of those links

02:35.270 --> 02:39.950
OK so first through it would be register

02:43.850 --> 02:46.950
and the second one would be logging.

02:47.270 --> 02:53.630
So this is what we are showing the users that are not out indicated.

02:53.630 --> 03:01.080
Also there is a way to verify in Lavell that certain route exists.

03:01.100 --> 03:09.100
So for cases that for example you do not allow everyone to create an account in your system.

03:09.110 --> 03:15.890
This might be useful for some systems that are like B2B so you are the only one who can create accounts

03:15.920 --> 03:18.740
they cannot register themselves.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.530
You can use the if directive to check that.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.480
So let's see how we can do that.

03:24.590 --> 03:35.360
So there is this If directive and we can use that route has to verify if the register route exists.

03:35.420 --> 03:40.500
So if it does display our registration link.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.620
So there is no else.

03:41.620 --> 03:46.990
So we only display it when we actually have that route.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.540
So this is the way you would do that.

03:49.610 --> 03:59.660
Now for the LS We would like to display a link to logout so let's copy this

04:02.560 --> 04:08.650
and specify it us logout and the route for logging out is log out.

04:08.650 --> 04:14.040
You can also check that using the peach bee artisan route least.

04:14.380 --> 04:21.380
But now seems this route is accepting only the post method not the get method.

04:21.430 --> 04:24.340
We will have to use forum methods.

04:24.410 --> 04:30.790
We will now since the logout link is now since the logo.

04:30.790 --> 04:37.720
The route is only working with the post method so we can't just use our direct link.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.870
We will have to add a forum.

04:40.870 --> 04:46.970
So let's see how we can do that for this case and all the other cases too.

04:46.990 --> 04:56.700
So we'll create a forum with the idea log logout form will specify an action which would be route log

04:56.920 --> 05:03.210
out so the same as in the link and the method would be post

05:07.350 --> 05:11.930
so let's close the forum and continue on the next line.

05:19.520 --> 05:26.010
And now we'll add some style to this forum because we do not want to actually display it.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.470
We only want the post request to be made for this forum.

05:31.510 --> 05:33.850
Now it since it's a forum.

05:33.850 --> 05:42.070
We need this C a directive to protect us from the cross site request forgery.

05:42.070 --> 05:51.970
Now what we will do is we will actually modify this encore to have an on click event so we'll write

05:52.000 --> 05:53.470
a little bit of JavaScript.

05:54.790 --> 06:02.920
So the first thing we'll have to do is to call event prevent default and what it is doing it is preventing

06:02.950 --> 06:05.780
this element default behavior.

06:05.800 --> 06:13.150
So default behavior would be when you click on it it will just direct you to this link using the get

06:13.150 --> 06:13.970
method.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.490
And we do not want that.

06:15.490 --> 06:26.950
So we have to call the prevent default first and only then we can use document get element by I.D. We'll

06:26.980 --> 06:37.120
find logout form and will submit this form and that is everything we have to do so we have this form

06:37.150 --> 06:39.340
and it's not being displayed.

06:39.370 --> 06:46.030
But when you will click on this link will prevent a default behavior and then send this forum that way

06:46.030 --> 06:54.830
we can make up both the request to the logout root OK save the changes and let's go back to the application

06:54.860 --> 06:57.500
and see what we see here.

06:58.340 --> 07:03.740
So we have our home contact blog posts art and a logo at the bottom.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.120
So let's click it now.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.290
Now what you see here is the 419 error.

07:09.350 --> 07:16.550
You actually shouldn't see that error if you made everything correctly by but I actually made a mistake

07:17.000 --> 07:19.460
I forgot to close the forum tag.

07:19.460 --> 07:28.640
So this CSO ref token wasn't actually sent and this is what happens when you send no CSO ref token with

07:28.640 --> 07:32.010
a form or it is invalid.

07:32.090 --> 07:39.380
So if I go back refresh and try to log out again you can see that now on the right we have the register

07:39.470 --> 07:44.060
and logging links and I log out successfully.

07:44.060 --> 07:52.040
So just so you know there is this very FICA serif token which is enabled for all of your roots and it

07:52.040 --> 07:56.810
lives inside the middleware folder inside HDP.

07:57.200 --> 08:05.450
So you can configure it so you can define some exceptions for which pages or which your eyes you do

08:05.450 --> 08:11.160
not want this CSR CSR red tokens validation to work.

08:11.180 --> 08:15.820
So this is actually important as an alliance called middleware.

08:16.310 --> 08:25.070
But the actual class is defined inside here so you can out click it and go inside it to see how that

08:25.070 --> 08:26.490
works.

08:26.510 --> 08:31.520
So there is this handle method and it does couple of checks.

08:31.520 --> 08:40.200
But the final one is tokens much so if you click it you can see that it is trying to get the token from

08:40.200 --> 08:48.960
request which means either getting the input field underscore token or the request header called ex

08:49.080 --> 08:50.660
CSA ref token.

08:50.820 --> 08:58.710
In my case when I forgot to close this form the underscore token field wasn't included with the form.

08:58.740 --> 09:06.750
That's why the tokens didn't match because it tried to fetch it and it was actually no that's why it

09:06.750 --> 09:13.530
costs an error and this token so much methods return false.

09:13.560 --> 09:19.890
So in case you are seeing there 419 error and you think you shouldn't be.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.010
This would be the place to check it.

09:22.860 --> 09:33.780
So you can even modify this file and for example do the DDA to see if the token is actually sent.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.740
So if file if I will remove this again and send it again with which won't include the underscore token

09:41.740 --> 09:42.750
field.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.380
Now here I should see that the token is no.

09:46.390 --> 09:49.270
So I would know where I made a mistake.

09:49.390 --> 09:54.280
So do not be afraid to sometimes modify those classes inside the vendor.

09:54.610 --> 09:57.430
I do not mean modify them permanent permanently.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.720
This you shouldn't do.

09:58.960 --> 10:05.920
But if you try to find an error and you have no idea where to look for it then you can might sometimes

10:05.920 --> 10:10.540
modify them just to see where the error might be.

10:10.540 --> 10:18.650
Well also sometimes another case might be that there is something wrong with your sessions like Lavell

10:18.670 --> 10:23.890
cannot write to the folder where your sessions are files are kept.

10:23.890 --> 10:29.690
Which would by default be the folder inside.

10:29.740 --> 10:34.050
Let me find that storage framework sessions.

10:34.060 --> 10:39.130
So here are the default session if you use that sessions as files stored.

10:39.130 --> 10:47.050
So make sure that Marable has the right permissions for this folder or the Apache server or however

10:47.050 --> 10:51.910
you are using it has the permissions to right to this folder.

10:51.910 --> 11:01.830
But generally let's go back to our layout so let's fix it up again and now we should be able to log

11:01.830 --> 11:06.020
in so I've registered previously with this account.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.820
And now when I log in.

11:07.860 --> 11:15.460
I am redirected back to their home page which we also have configured and now I see the logout page.

11:15.570 --> 11:23.850
So in the next lecture it might be a good idea to modify who can access those buttons because now anyone

11:23.850 --> 11:32.220
can edit or delete blog posts so we should prevent users that are at least not authenticated so they

11:32.220 --> 11:33.280
can't do that.

11:33.300 --> 11:40.820
And in the future we will only allow the users that actually created those blog posts to edit and delete

11:40.830 --> 11:41.160
them.
