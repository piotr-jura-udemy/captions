In this lecture we will see how we can retrieve some information about the currently authenticated user.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.660
So what I have here is the Visual Studio code on the left with the home controller active and on the

00:15.660 --> 00:20.080
right there is our Web site with the home page active.

00:20.250 --> 00:28.590
So if you guys are wondering how I achieved this split screen it's just a mark feature where I can split

00:28.590 --> 00:33.280
the two applications into one screen anyway.

00:33.330 --> 00:40.110
First let's log out and then make sure that you logging using some of the existing accounts or you can

00:40.110 --> 00:44.680
just register because we have already implemented that and it works.

00:44.850 --> 00:51.160
But I have an account so I will just log in and go to the home page.

00:51.220 --> 00:57.800
Now the two fetch the currently authenticated user will use that our phosphate class.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.600
So first will import it.

01:00.600 --> 01:11.750
So it can be found inside Illuminate Support for phosphates.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.110
So that's the class we will use.

01:15.250 --> 01:21.520
And now it has a couple of static methods so the first one that might be interesting is ideas.

01:21.820 --> 01:30.210
So let's surrounded with DDA to dump this idea of the currently authenticated user or the new value.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.330
So let's see what it gets.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.260
So we are receiving free.

01:34.300 --> 01:39.300
And this happens to be the I.D. of the user that I am authenticated out.

01:39.610 --> 01:44.650
So we will use that to fetch the I.D. of the currently authenticated user.

01:44.650 --> 01:55.370
Or you can just open this health class by clicking it with the alt key pressed and you can see all the

01:55.370 --> 01:58.550
possible methods that this failsafe can return.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.310
So let's see our I.D. method.

02:02.330 --> 02:09.560
So the I.T. method can return an integer which would be the idea of the user or no.

02:10.490 --> 02:19.550
Alternatively there is the user method and the user method would return model of the currently authenticated

02:19.580 --> 02:20.410
user.

02:20.450 --> 02:25.790
So as you can see on the attributes it contains all the attributes of myself.

02:25.790 --> 02:29.310
So the currently authenticated user.

02:29.570 --> 02:35.970
Now the first useful method of this hourglass is check.

02:35.990 --> 02:43.450
So this would just return a bullion of whether the current user is authenticated or not.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.700
So this might also be useful.

02:46.770 --> 02:47.030
So.

02:47.030 --> 02:47.340
OK.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.400
Now let's remove that.

02:49.400 --> 02:58.030
Or alternatively I can just store that so you will know later how to use these comments and what is

02:58.030 --> 02:58.630
available.

02:58.630 --> 03:04.570
I will comment that out and commit that to the repository so we can always find this.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.590
But now let's see how we can actually do something useful.

03:08.590 --> 03:20.670
So let's open our layout so it would be inside resources views lay out the blade BHP so inside the layout

03:20.730 --> 03:27.600
we can try to show the user name so maybe the only way we can put the user name might be inside the

03:27.600 --> 03:28.770
logout button.

03:28.830 --> 03:35.920
We can just surrounded with parentheses and inside it showed the current user name.

03:36.420 --> 03:43.320
So in this case we can be pretty certain that the user is authenticated because this is what the guest

03:43.320 --> 03:45.060
directive is doing.

03:45.090 --> 03:52.530
So this would be only rendered when the user won't be authenticated and everything after else up to

03:52.530 --> 03:57.990
there and the guest is only rendered when user is authenticated.

03:57.990 --> 04:08.370
So here we can also interpolate safely using the South for Sayed and using the user function.

04:08.490 --> 04:14.320
So user has this named field that we can display here.

04:14.340 --> 04:21.780
So now let's go to the right side and refresh maybe now let's enlarge that a little bit and you can

04:21.780 --> 04:24.080
see that this part was rendered.

04:24.090 --> 04:29.850
So now inside the logout button we see the name of the current user.
