00:00.360 --> 00:06.870
So in the last lecture you've seen how to use the guest middle where to redirect when you are already

00:06.870 --> 00:08.910
out integrated.

00:08.940 --> 00:12.390
Now let's go and work on the logging forum.

00:12.570 --> 00:19.560
So starting with the logging controller from our project the first thing you would like to modify is

00:19.560 --> 00:24.720
the page you are being redirected to after you successfully logging.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.960
So let's change it to something that exists.

00:26.970 --> 00:32.010
So just slash because this home route doesn't exist.

00:32.010 --> 00:33.300
So save the changes.

00:33.300 --> 00:41.940
And now it uses this authenticates users straight and the show logging form action is responsible for

00:41.940 --> 00:51.060
displaying their logging form and it expects it to be of that logging where dot translates to the directory

00:51.060 --> 00:52.610
separator.

00:52.680 --> 01:04.390
So we should go to our reviews our folder and inside it create a new logging blade BHP.

01:04.410 --> 01:08.520
Now fortunately we do not have to write it from scratch.

01:08.580 --> 01:14.880
We can just copy the registration form and we want of course need everything from it.

01:14.880 --> 01:20.260
For example we do not need the name field.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.910
We will keep the e-mail.

01:22.060 --> 01:30.250
And if you remember it or not we won't be providing the user name for the user name credential for the

01:30.250 --> 01:40.150
user name part of the credentials because inside the authenticate users there is this validate logging

01:40.510 --> 01:46.930
method and inside it it is calling that this user name.

01:46.930 --> 01:54.360
So this method that you can of course define inside the logging controller to override it.

01:54.550 --> 02:00.550
It is specifying what is the name of the user name field.

02:02.350 --> 02:10.510
So since it is e-mail by default we can use the e-mail field name if you would like it to be for example

02:10.510 --> 02:15.010
user name if you will have this field on your user model.

02:15.010 --> 02:20.200
You can change that inside logging controller by overriding this method.

02:20.230 --> 02:29.070
So basically that means you will just copy it and paste it here maybe after the constructor it's a good

02:29.070 --> 02:31.320
practice to do that and modify it.

02:31.350 --> 02:38.520
Us user name that way the field used for user name would be user name not email.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.580
But we won't do that.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.860
So I'll just comment that out and leave it here.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.450
So you remember how to do that.

02:45.130 --> 02:48.390
OK let's go back to our logging forum.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.530
So we have the email and we also need passwords.

02:52.540 --> 02:59.820
So it's good for us but we do not need this because we do not have any password to retyped.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.600
We only do that when registering.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.110
And also we need to change the label to logging.

03:06.280 --> 03:13.870
And final thing is the action this form is being sent to so we have this route called register for registering

03:13.930 --> 03:15.860
and for logging in.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.160
It is called logging.

03:18.160 --> 03:25.120
You can check that by running BHP Artie's en route list and the forum when it will be sent.

03:25.120 --> 03:30.900
It would be directed to the logging method.

03:31.260 --> 03:36.960
So this is the one I've explained before.

03:37.010 --> 03:43.280
Now we have our forum and basically that is everything that you have to do you can also customize it

03:43.310 --> 03:43.990
if you want.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.440
If you would like some additional fields and we actually would like one additional field and this field

03:51.440 --> 03:52.280
would be called.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.590
Remember me.

03:54.590 --> 03:58.200
So we will allow the users to be remembered.

03:58.250 --> 04:03.020
So that's their session will be stored inside our cookie.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.520
So let's add a new field for this checkbox

04:11.270 --> 04:16.100
and inside it we'll use another class from bootstrap called Forum check

04:22.920 --> 04:32.770
and now lets out the input so it also needs a couple of classes from bootstrap to look nicely one of

04:32.770 --> 04:37.600
them is check forum check input.

04:37.600 --> 04:47.050
The type is checkbox and the name has to be remember and this is because that's the name of the parameter

04:47.110 --> 04:54.610
expected inside our logging controller to remember the user that was logged in.

04:54.610 --> 04:56.480
You can even find it here.

04:59.670 --> 05:10.000
When you find the remember parameter it's checking if the request contains the remember set us the checked

05:10.000 --> 05:18.940
field and then this attempt the method from the guard accepts the Remember Me as a boolean as a as its

05:18.940 --> 05:23.340
second parameter after credentials OK.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.060
So let's go back to doing our input.

05:27.930 --> 05:37.040
OK so we have the type we have the name and also we can use that value and specify all the value.

05:37.100 --> 05:43.970
In case this was checked before for example when someone is would specify an old password we can keep

05:44.540 --> 05:46.050
the old value.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.720
So now you can see how to do that with checkboxes.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.900
So we'll do it like this.

05:52.730 --> 05:54.950
If old remember

05:58.570 --> 06:08.570
if this would be true will echo checked and if you would if this would evaluate to false will just not

06:08.570 --> 06:09.590
return anything.

06:09.590 --> 06:19.100
That way we can keep the value of the input checkbox in record requests for example when this request

06:19.100 --> 06:21.450
would fail.

06:21.720 --> 06:28.700
Okay so we have the input and we should also add a label with specific class.

06:28.840 --> 06:39.550
That would be form check label and also specify what this is the label for and it is for ream.

06:39.850 --> 06:40.660
Remember

06:44.140 --> 06:52.750
and just specify the text that would be displayed inside like re member mi okay.

06:52.760 --> 07:01.010
We have our form ready but before we will be able to see it we need to log out somehow.

07:01.070 --> 07:08.750
So in the next lecture we'll modify our header for our application so that we would have a logout button

07:08.960 --> 07:10.730
when we are authenticated.
