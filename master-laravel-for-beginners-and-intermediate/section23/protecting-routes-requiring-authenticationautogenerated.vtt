00:00.690 --> 00:06.250
Now let's see how we can protect certain routes from being accessible to everyone.

00:06.390 --> 00:14.430
So we have seen previously that we can attach the middle were to certain routes and we can also attach

00:14.430 --> 00:19.990
the guest middle where to force that those routes can be accessible by everyone.

00:20.010 --> 00:26.430
So the first way to attach this off middle middleware to require authentication on a specific route

00:26.460 --> 00:33.840
would be inside our route definition file namely inside web BHP or the API BHP.

00:33.900 --> 00:38.540
If you are developing an API but we are into it.

00:38.790 --> 00:47.100
So you can just change another method call at the end of the route definition and add middleware.

00:47.100 --> 00:55.470
So if we will are done me meter were for this home controller home page which is what you see on the

00:55.470 --> 00:56.880
right.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.340
Save the changes here.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.060
And now let's refresh the page on the right.

01:03.030 --> 01:08.840
So you can see that I wasn't authenticated because there my name wasn't displayed.

01:08.910 --> 01:13.080
And now if I go to the contact page I can still see it.

01:13.230 --> 01:18.600
But if I go to the home page I am being redirected to the logging forum.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.630
Of course this doesn't make sense to protect this route but it is just an example of how you can do

01:24.630 --> 01:25.130
it.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.460
So that's the first way.

01:26.760 --> 01:35.770
So let's maybe we can move that to the next line so you will know how to do that and save the save it

01:35.770 --> 01:37.480
and keep it.

01:37.480 --> 01:45.940
And now if you are using controllers and we are using controllers so this way I show you shown you before

01:45.940 --> 01:46.800
can work.

01:46.810 --> 01:52.990
Also if you are defining your routes as closures and basically that's the only way if you are using

01:52.990 --> 01:59.800
closures but if you are using controllers we might do that inside post controller.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.690
This would make much more sense to protect certain routes inside it.

02:04.930 --> 02:11.910
You can define a typical PDB constructor using underscore a construct.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.100
Of course we need to function keyword here

02:17.980 --> 02:25.210
and now inside the controller constructor we can call this middleware.

02:26.340 --> 02:31.760
So this would protect every single route from this post controller.

02:31.770 --> 02:37.170
So now if I will go to the blog posts I am required to be authenticated.

02:37.170 --> 02:41.530
So I am being redirected to the logging page the same with adding.

02:42.150 --> 02:49.980
So nothing really is accessible to me right now or of course if I will log in you can see that I can

02:49.980 --> 02:57.660
see both the form for adding and the blog posts and editing everything works for me.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.820
Now let's see how we can do that.

02:59.850 --> 03:02.790
If we only want to protect certain routes.

03:02.790 --> 03:06.300
So for this I've said that before.

03:06.300 --> 03:16.920
But let's remind ourselves we can use either only or accept methods so only can accept string.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.620
So.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.300
Well it's up to you how do you like to define this.

03:20.310 --> 03:29.840
But we can use only with an array and specify the method names that we would like to protect.

03:29.840 --> 03:36.590
So we want to protect the index because we probably would like everyone to read our blog posts the same

03:36.590 --> 03:45.290
with show but certainly we do not want to let anyone add blog posts if there are not authenticated.

03:45.380 --> 03:50.510
So let's out create first save the changes.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.050
And now let's see we can read blog posts.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.800
A single one and the list of them.

03:56.330 --> 04:00.090
But when you press hard you can't see the form.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.990
Obviously that's not everything.

04:02.990 --> 04:12.090
We should also protect store added update and destroy so let's at that store.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.720
Edit Update

04:18.310 --> 04:20.500
destroy.

04:20.640 --> 04:26.400
So now all those routes are protected if you will go to the blog post list and Press Edit you can see

04:26.400 --> 04:29.100
that you are being redirected the same with delete.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.890
You can't do that.

04:31.050 --> 04:38.730
You can only view blog posts so that's a pretty simple way you can also do that when we will later implements

04:38.750 --> 04:40.460
come implement commenting.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.960
But this is the second way.

04:41.970 --> 04:49.290
And for me it is the preferred way to decide how to protect certain routes inside.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.100
Controllers

04:53.180 --> 05:00.600
so let's save the changes and then we will see how we can actually attach users to certain models.

05:00.600 --> 05:08.250
So when someone is being out integrated he is being assigned to a certain blog post so we can see who

05:08.260 --> 05:10.590
altered our certain blog post.
