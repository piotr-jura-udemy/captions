00:00.330 --> 00:06.600
Now in the last lecture when we have set up readies us our storage for the cash and you should already

00:06.600 --> 00:09.190
do that to learn from this lecture.

00:09.390 --> 00:15.360
We said that cash stocks can only be used if your storage is either readies or ma'am cash.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.060
So it's not supported for us storage.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.110
That is database like my school or the file system.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.530
Now let's see what actually are the cash stocks and how can we use them to our benefit.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.480
So for this let's run to be artisan thinker.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.950
And now we can play around a little bit with the cash.

00:36.030 --> 00:42.300
So first we'll try to store an item inside the cash and we'll use tax for that.

00:42.990 --> 00:49.710
So you can access the cash for Sade but first instead of calling put method which will store something

00:49.710 --> 00:52.840
inside the cash you need to use tags.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.080
So we'll go ahead and use an example from larval documentation.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.820
So we will like to tag this item with the people tag.

01:02.130 --> 01:05.090
And also an artists tag.

01:06.510 --> 01:14.030
And only then we can use port and we'll store it under the key John value can be.

01:14.050 --> 01:17.680
Hello I'm I'm John.

01:17.950 --> 01:20.610
And we'll start that for 10 minutes.

01:23.290 --> 01:30.460
Now the thing with cash stocks is that you have to always specify the tax when you store an item.

01:30.460 --> 01:37.710
And also you have to specify the same exact least of tax if you want to read the item from the cash.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.130
So that's really important.

01:39.130 --> 01:45.220
I will show you in a moment what will happen if you want to read an item and you don't provide the tax

01:45.430 --> 01:48.940
which you have provided when storing an item.

01:48.940 --> 01:53.500
So now to read this item we'll have to do cash tags.

01:53.590 --> 02:04.270
We'll have to say that the tax where people and artists only then we can use get and read the item under

02:04.270 --> 02:04.900
the key.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.500
John and we have the virus.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.680
Hello I am John.

02:09.830 --> 02:20.090
Now if you will like to do cash get and read the key John it won't read that so it's not available.

02:20.090 --> 02:27.380
So this is basically I would say it's a problem it doesn't make tax usable as you think you they could

02:27.380 --> 02:30.350
be but this is the way they work.

02:30.350 --> 02:37.250
So to store an item you have to provide a list of tax but then to read an item you always have to provide

02:37.280 --> 02:40.190
a list of the same tags.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.830
So now let's see how the tax can be useful.

02:44.270 --> 02:52.340
So let's store another item using cash tax will also other people tag.

02:52.740 --> 02:58.050
But this time another tag would be outers.

02:58.260 --> 03:07.930
So now we can call pooled and the key would be on and the value can be Hello I'm um.

03:08.180 --> 03:14.340
We'll also store that for 10 minutes now to read this value.

03:14.350 --> 03:21.310
You will also have to provide a list of tax like people and outers.

03:21.310 --> 03:22.690
So let's do that.

03:22.690 --> 03:28.660
Get Um and now you can read this volume.

03:29.080 --> 03:37.180
So the useful thing with tax is that you can actually you remove all the cash items that now can contain

03:37.240 --> 03:42.460
at least one of those stocks that you have provided for the above items.

03:42.460 --> 03:52.630
So let's see we have store John using people and artists stocks but we have also stored arm using people

03:53.260 --> 03:54.670
and outers sorry.

03:54.670 --> 04:01.170
So this John was using people and artists and using people and outdoors.

04:01.660 --> 04:06.670
So now we can actually remove items and only provide one tag.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.560
So how we will do this is we can call cache tags.

04:11.710 --> 04:21.680
We can use the common tag like people and then call flash and this will remove all the items that were

04:21.680 --> 04:23.110
cached with people.

04:23.120 --> 04:29.120
So here you actually don't have to provide all the taxes that were used to initially store an item.

04:29.120 --> 04:35.240
And thanks to that we'll remove every cache item that has that people tag.

04:35.240 --> 04:40.010
And in our case it happens to be also John but also an.

04:41.330 --> 04:50.190
So now let's copy this item copy this line where we have Red John and now you can see that it is no.

04:50.240 --> 04:58.580
But also if you would try to read the element under the key arm you also see that it is normal.

04:58.580 --> 05:05.210
So what you can use it for is if you have a certain category of cache items inside your application

05:05.240 --> 05:07.300
let's say we have a simple block.

05:07.330 --> 05:15.290
So we might cache some items using the block post stack and some different tacks but if we would like

05:15.290 --> 05:23.480
to remove those those items let's say in this simple application we cache items when we open a blog

05:23.480 --> 05:23.840
post.

05:23.840 --> 05:32.180
So this could be cached using the blog post stack but also we can cache items here on the most commented

05:32.180 --> 05:32.840
blog posts.

05:32.840 --> 05:40.880
They also can contain our blog post stack and then if we want to refresh our application like we'll

05:41.270 --> 05:47.790
see on example the next lecture about let's say we want to reset the cache every time around midnight.

05:48.020 --> 05:54.560
You can do that using a simple call to the cache stocks and use flash.

05:54.560 --> 06:01.990
So this will remove all the cash that was created using this particular tack.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.680
So this is a very useful option to use cash stocks but mostly it is about removing a group of items.
