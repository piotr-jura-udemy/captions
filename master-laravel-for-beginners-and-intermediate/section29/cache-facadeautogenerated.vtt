00:00.630 --> 00:10.230
Now let's open the terminal and run BHP artisan thinker so we'll learn about some more methods of cash

00:10.230 --> 00:18.610
manipulation so we can use cash for say here and the first method would be on how to store items.

00:18.630 --> 00:25.110
So we already know about cash remember but there is also a simple method where you can just store some

00:25.110 --> 00:25.700
data.

00:26.130 --> 00:32.330
So the first argument is the key name so low the anything like Data.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.880
Now the second argument would be what would you like to store.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.360
This can be anything.

00:39.440 --> 00:46.740
Now we can store some tax like hell from cash and the first argument would be the time for which you

00:46.740 --> 00:53.880
would like to store this item in cash in minutes or if you will use the date time object or carbon object

00:54.180 --> 00:57.460
then you can specify some detailed time.

00:57.510 --> 01:02.850
Now if you will do it like that this cash item would be stored forever.

01:02.970 --> 01:10.140
And what that means is it would be stored as long as the cash server is running or in case of files.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.770
As long as the files exist there.

01:12.780 --> 01:21.900
So they are not removed and to delete this item from the cache you will have to explicitly delete it

01:22.200 --> 01:28.360
and to remove this item from cache you will have to explicitly delete it using the forget method.

01:28.890 --> 01:33.730
But let's store it for five minutes now.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.410
It returns normal.

01:35.660 --> 01:44.680
But now let's see how we can check if certain item already exists in cache so we can use the Hess method

01:45.140 --> 01:46.700
and we have to provide a key.

01:46.820 --> 01:49.230
So that's the only argument.

01:49.460 --> 01:56.660
Now you can see that it returns true if we will use has for something else like Data to.

01:57.020 --> 02:02.600
It returns false because it wasn't stored in the cache before.

02:02.600 --> 02:08.150
Now we can also retrieve data from the cache using cache get

02:11.070 --> 02:16.860
so you can do cache get data and you see that we got the message Hello from cache

02:19.580 --> 02:19.930
now.

02:19.950 --> 02:26.520
If you will like to retrieve data to which we know is not inside the cache you will get no.

02:26.880 --> 02:36.360
But alternatively you can do cache get data too and as a second argument provide a default value

02:40.190 --> 02:46.310
so it's not like remember it won't store this value inside the cache it is just providing a default

02:46.400 --> 02:50.070
if the item cannot be found inside the cash.

02:50.390 --> 02:57.590
Now there are also additional methods and they might be very useful and they are called increment and

02:57.620 --> 02:58.880
decrement.

02:58.880 --> 03:08.910
So what that does is for a particular cache item let's say counter we can incremented an integer value

03:11.530 --> 03:17.590
so for example I already had an element called counter and it has incremented it to 2.

03:17.590 --> 03:25.930
Now if I'll find something that I didn't have in cash let's say free x you can see that it is 1.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.340
So it assumes it starts with 0.

03:28.390 --> 03:35.890
If nothing is in cache but then it can increment it also we can do cache decrement

03:42.270 --> 03:43.970
and now it is zero.

03:44.010 --> 03:51.670
So we've learned some basic methods of the cache for safe to manipulate our cash and now let's use it.

03:51.720 --> 03:59.670
Use that as an example when on the blog post page will implement a Basic counter of how many people

03:59.730 --> 04:03.570
are reading this blog post in current time.
