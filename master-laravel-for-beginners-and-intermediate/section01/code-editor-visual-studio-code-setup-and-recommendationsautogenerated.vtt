00:00.730 --> 00:06.740
The Visual Studio Code is the recommended editor to use during this course vote.

00:06.790 --> 00:11.320
There are other options available and it's not a strict requirement.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.430
I highly recommend using voice code notice.

00:15.580 --> 00:23.050
This lecture is optional and everything's shown in it is just a recommendation not required to complete

00:23.050 --> 00:26.970
the course at all and definitely not a prerequisite.

00:27.760 --> 00:35.110
You are totally fine to skip this lecture and go back to it whenever you wish if you'd like to set up

00:35.110 --> 00:37.120
videoscope the way I did.

00:38.260 --> 00:46.720
Sylvia's code is a free ed from Microsoft available on all operating systems, you can grab it from

00:46.720 --> 00:50.400
this website, please download and install it.

00:50.410 --> 00:56.620
Now I suggest posing the video now and getting back when you are done installing.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.660
Let's have a quick overview of the program on the left side, there's the activity bar.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.690
There you can see old files from your project.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.750
You can search through files.

01:09.510 --> 01:14.400
Users control Likit and install additional extensions.

01:15.580 --> 01:23.080
In the center, there is the main area of the Kodaly Dora, the power of the code comes mostly from

01:23.080 --> 01:25.560
the vast library of extensions available.

01:26.020 --> 01:31.580
I recommend so many not mentioning all of them would probably take half an hour.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.040
We are fortunate.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.330
Vote very cold, lets you quickly get the list of extensions I use.

01:38.020 --> 01:42.630
Just download their zip file attached to this lecture resources.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.690
The quick trick I'm going to explain next is optional.

01:47.230 --> 01:51.030
If it's too much for you or it does not work anymore, don't worry.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.590
There is another way shown right after.

01:56.310 --> 02:03.540
The code lets you have a workspace, specific settings, the settings are kept in a separate folder

02:03.540 --> 02:12.480
in your project name to dot the code, I've exported mine, including a list of all recommended extensions

02:12.480 --> 02:13.410
to install.

02:15.660 --> 02:20.070
Please pause the video and download this files now.

02:22.760 --> 02:28.590
Then unpack them to any folder, then open this folder in the editor.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.650
This can be quickly done by dragging the folder into the code icon.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.950
Next, create a folder called DOT.

02:42.100 --> 02:47.320
These code moved the two files into this folder.

02:53.610 --> 02:55.740
And then quit the cold.

02:58.690 --> 03:04.390
Reopen this folder again by dragging onto the cold ICAM.

03:07.980 --> 03:12.900
From the view menu, select the command bulette or use the shortcut.

03:14.500 --> 03:23.290
And type show recommended this should be enough to see this command click on the command presented.

03:30.560 --> 03:38.120
It will show you the least of all extensions I recommend installing now, you will need to go through

03:38.120 --> 03:40.400
each one of them and press install.

03:51.500 --> 03:57.800
Now, alternatively, just download this zip file and open the extensions, Jason file.

03:59.950 --> 04:04.930
From recommendation's copy to code names of plugins.

04:10.390 --> 04:14.710
And paste them into the search on the extension Staab.

04:21.070 --> 04:24.510
You will have to do that one by one, but it will work.

04:27.690 --> 04:37.140
The FEMA use is called Umbra, it has great contrasts and the fonts I recommend is Cascadia Code Fira

04:37.150 --> 04:40.110
Code Operator MÃ¶rner or Mennel.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.530
Most can be downloaded online for free.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.290
Some are installed on your system.

04:49.930 --> 04:54.280
You can open the terminal inside the passcode.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.240
And run command in the currently open project to Route The View.

05:03.420 --> 05:09.780
Terminal menu will also show the shortcut you can use, we will sometimes use that feature.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.260
They're already mentioned command pallette.

05:16.930 --> 05:22.480
Is useful to run some voice code commands, like to format the currently open file.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.480
Make sure you remember this shortcut.

05:28.690 --> 05:29.780
It's very handy.

05:30.850 --> 05:33.310
Then they go.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.350
Go to five menu.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.330
Is something we'll use a lot.

05:40.650 --> 05:49.130
It lets you quickly jump to a file also noticed a shortcut for this comment on your system.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.120
It would be useful to remember.
