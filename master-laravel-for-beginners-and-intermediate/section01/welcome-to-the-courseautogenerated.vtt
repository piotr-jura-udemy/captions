Hello and welcome.

00:01.680 --> 00:05.560
My name is Bill Roura, and I am your instructor in discourse.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.090
I am very happy to have you on board in the next couple of hours.

00:10.230 --> 00:11.550
I'm going to tell you everything.

00:11.550 --> 00:18.090
A beginner wanting to start building applications in Laravel should know you will be transformed from

00:18.090 --> 00:20.670
a Laravel beginner to the Laravel expert.

00:21.540 --> 00:27.120
Before we get into technical details, I'd like to give you a short overview of the course.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.460
First of the Udemy UI.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.860
The curriculum is on the right side.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.100
Clicking on the lectures will take you to this specific lecture.

00:35.730 --> 00:42.240
This resources button means there is something extra added to the lecture that might be diagrams for

00:42.240 --> 00:47.730
you to download sars-cov-2 or an external link to some other learning resource.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.360
Now the player you can post videos when needed, rewind or go forward.

00:53.370 --> 00:56.630
Most importantly, you can speed me up or slow me down.

00:57.180 --> 01:02.430
I talk slowly so beginners can understand and people that prefer to type along can catch up.

01:02.820 --> 01:05.430
If your time is limited, increase the video speed.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.850
I can still be easily understood at twice the speed.

01:10.460 --> 01:17.300
When you need to add notes for yourself, President Noad Button volume can be changed here, video quality

01:17.300 --> 01:19.470
can be changed using this settings button.

01:19.700 --> 01:24.710
I suggest playing at the outdoor setting, which at its best can play full HD.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.460
If you have questions, click Q&amp;A.

01:27.620 --> 01:32.120
The questions and answers and ask a question is best.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.110
If you ask the question under a specific lecture you can take.

01:36.110 --> 01:42.380
If your question is not answered already, you can skip lectures by pressing the arrow buttons on the

01:42.380 --> 01:44.350
left and right sides.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.310
Sometimes I even advise skipping.

01:46.310 --> 01:50.900
For example, when you are on windows, there is no point in watching instructions for MapQuest set

01:50.900 --> 01:51.140
up.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.820
Finally, you can join our discourse community.

01:55.340 --> 02:00.620
This is a free chat application where you can talk to other students in our community.

02:01.370 --> 02:06.560
I'm really glad you joined the cause and I can't wait until we dive into this great framework, which

02:06.560 --> 02:08.480
Laravel certainly is together.
