00:00.270 --> 00:06.620
A quick note for you guys, wondering if this course is for you or what Laravel version does it cover?

00:07.290 --> 00:12.960
You need to know the Laravel has recently changed the way it is versioned version.

00:12.960 --> 00:24.710
FIFO was released on February 4th, 2015, and version five eight on February 26, 2019.

00:25.470 --> 00:29.940
So the version five was out there for four full years.

00:30.890 --> 00:37.600
Now, since version six of Laravel Date has changed, the new major version is out every six months.

00:38.150 --> 00:47.240
So Version six came out September 2019 and by September 2020, we already have version eight.

00:48.110 --> 00:50.480
So what does that mean for you?

00:51.350 --> 00:57.950
Well, you can probably imagine that you can't squeeze so many changes in a software project in six

00:57.950 --> 01:01.160
months that you could in four years.

01:01.940 --> 01:09.290
Well, I'm trying to say that, as I recall, this November 2020, eight four is the most up to date

01:09.290 --> 01:10.690
version of Laravel.

01:10.700 --> 01:17.000
But if you watch this in March 2021, then nine is the most recent version.

01:17.950 --> 01:19.630
Is this completely different?

01:20.200 --> 01:22.180
Do you have an outdated course?

01:22.570 --> 01:23.810
No, not at all.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.370
Their principles stay the same.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.480
There might be slight changes here and there, but nothing that beginners should worry about anyway.

01:32.350 --> 01:35.050
So don't worry about the version of Laravel.

01:35.050 --> 01:36.120
You'll be fine.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.870
The course is updated on a regular basis anyway.

01:40.420 --> 01:46.540
It was originally recorded when version five seven was out, so I got you covered there.
