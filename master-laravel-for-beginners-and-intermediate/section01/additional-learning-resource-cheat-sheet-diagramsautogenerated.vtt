Their course contains quite some diagrams and visual explanations, often you can find these diagrams

00:08.700 --> 00:12.720
attached to the lecture so you can look at them closer later.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.690
There is a page on GitHub called Laravel Cheat Sheet, where you can find some additional information

00:20.690 --> 00:21.980
on certain topics.

00:24.370 --> 00:31.480
This is sometimes updated to contain the fresh information, you are not required to use it, but it's

00:31.480 --> 00:32.010
there.

00:33.510 --> 00:41.220
Sometimes there are additional resources you can read about and then links are included under their

00:41.220 --> 00:43.050
lecture resources.

00:45.110 --> 00:52.280
Finally, I need to stress that the course is structured to guide you through the framework features

00:52.280 --> 00:57.910
in a specific way, which I think is the correct order to understand the material.

00:58.460 --> 01:04.760
But to remember this course is not the only resource online to learn and get information from.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.220
And I am pretty open about it as I want you to succeed.

01:09.860 --> 01:16.700
Laravel Documentation is a great source of information with a lot of examples whenever in doubt, try

01:16.700 --> 01:18.840
checking out in their documentation.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.650
Remember, you don't need to memorize everything.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.470
It's enough if you are able to find your way around.

01:27.140 --> 01:32.570
So if you are having questions or issues, it's fine to just search Google.

01:33.080 --> 01:38.680
Usually you will find a lot of people have asked the same questions as you did.
