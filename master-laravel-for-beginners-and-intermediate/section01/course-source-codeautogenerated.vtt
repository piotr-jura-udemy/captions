00:00.610 --> 00:07.540
The source code for discourse is available on GitHub, which is a platform to host code, including

00:07.540 --> 00:10.740
all the changes made in the project called comets.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.530
Thanks to this, you can do many interesting things.

00:15.460 --> 00:22.900
First off, you can browse cource code with the state that it had after every single lecture, just

00:22.900 --> 00:29.170
go to the comet least and find a comet that matches the title of the lecture that you are watching.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.380
Click this button to browse the code with the state it had at a specific point.

00:39.210 --> 00:46.230
Pressing the green code button will give you some options, like downloading the code at a specific

00:46.230 --> 00:47.250
point in a zip.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.940
Or if something does not work and you think you typed the code correctly, just find the file you are

00:58.940 --> 01:02.000
working with and verify if yours looks the same.

01:03.090 --> 01:10.890
For example, at this point, we were talking about partial templates and creating a partial template

01:10.890 --> 01:12.690
called Post Blade BHP.

01:13.590 --> 01:19.620
Prayers go to file and type post Blade BHB.

01:20.660 --> 01:25.640
And this is how this fire looked like after the specific lecture.

01:28.060 --> 01:34.280
Another useful feature is to review all the changes made during a specific lecture.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.820
Let's go back to the Middle East.

01:41.910 --> 01:49.620
Click the comet's title, this letter is about form request classes had the following changes made.

01:50.750 --> 01:56.990
Green color means the code added and the red color, the code that was removed.

01:58.290 --> 02:01.510
Remember, the cold is always there available for you.

02:01.980 --> 02:08.910
Alternatively, if you prefer, under this very lecture, there is the zip file containing the full

02:08.920 --> 02:15.600
source code of this course into files, specifically for the first introductory section, which was

02:15.600 --> 02:21.630
recently rerecorded from scratch and the other containing the whole full course code.
