00:01.110 --> 00:09.480
Let's take a quick overview of the prerequisites of this course, you can use any operating system and

00:09.480 --> 00:11.640
successfully complete this course.

00:12.480 --> 00:19.770
I've recorded separate INDEF instructions for setting up your environment with both Mac OS and Windows

00:20.310 --> 00:21.030
Alvo.

00:21.240 --> 00:29.220
Linux instructions are not recorded 95 percent of the time things work the same as on Mac as both systems

00:29.220 --> 00:31.620
share a common ancestor, Unix.

00:32.820 --> 00:37.920
To complete the course, you will need certain software installed on your computer.

00:38.190 --> 00:47.910
It is absolutely essential to have BHB MySQL database and Noge as installed and some kind of code Edita.

00:50.070 --> 00:57.240
Don't worry, though, you will be guided step by step on how to get up and running to get the basic

00:57.240 --> 01:03.810
software, you might use some of the pre-existing packages like Zamp or Mump.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.410
This are recommended for beginners.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.400
You can also use doctor or vagrant.

01:12.580 --> 01:18.820
Tools available for all systems or Laravel valid, which is only for Mark.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.350
The course covers installing and setting up of some.

01:25.350 --> 01:33.660
You will install the Apache Web server, MySQL database, be set up, be to run scripts on the command

01:33.660 --> 01:37.630
line and install composer to manage dependencies.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.500
Finally, you will set up a custom local domain for the project, though that's optional.

01:45.200 --> 01:53.270
For writing the code, I recommend Visual Studio Code, it's very powerful, works on all operating

01:53.270 --> 01:54.060
systems.

01:54.440 --> 01:58.510
It has a rich set of extensions and is extremely popular.

01:58.940 --> 02:02.990
If you plan to code along, please use visual studio code.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.060
I can't stress enough how important that is.

02:06.740 --> 02:14.810
There is a separate lecture on suggested extension's themes and fonts to make your environment as close

02:14.810 --> 02:16.360
to mine as possible.

02:17.320 --> 02:25.600
There are other options, though, like baby storm, this is a powerful fully-fledged ID, though it

02:25.600 --> 02:27.010
is a paid option.

02:30.370 --> 02:34.660
Whether you plan to code along or just watch.

02:35.980 --> 02:43.990
You need to know the full source code for the course is available on GitHub and as a download more on

02:43.990 --> 02:47.950
how to get and use the source code in a separate lecture.

02:51.520 --> 02:58.960
I also need to mention that to learn comfortably in this course, it will be really good if you had

02:58.960 --> 03:08.740
any previous experience with HP databases, HDMI, and you understand how the Web works, trying to

03:08.740 --> 03:14.920
learn are back in framework without any previous programming, knowledge would be pretty hard.

03:17.290 --> 03:25.900
Finally, it's possible you might be having issues either with the set up process or later, I've tried

03:25.900 --> 03:33.850
hard to make sure the instructions are as clear as possible, but still, everyone has their own experience

03:33.850 --> 03:35.010
and knowledge level.

03:35.500 --> 03:42.250
If you feel stuck, please ask a question in the Q&amp;A section under a lecture you are having an issue

03:42.250 --> 03:42.610
with.

03:43.120 --> 03:49.780
Please also join our Dischord community where you can ask questions and get help from other students

03:49.780 --> 03:50.200
to.
