00:00.360 --> 00:06.270
Now in the last lecture we tried to display the image that was added to the blog post and this is what

00:06.270 --> 00:07.290
we have ended up.

00:07.290 --> 00:13.500
So we found a way to display the proper URL for the image but it doesn't look really well.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.160
You will probably agree with that that it's not really readable.

00:17.160 --> 00:21.170
This is not how modern page should look like.

00:21.210 --> 00:24.540
So now let's play around with Styles a little bit.

00:24.540 --> 00:30.650
So we what we want to achieve is just display this image on the background.

00:30.870 --> 00:39.960
So first since we allow blog post to be submitted without an image we should try and verify if the Post

00:40.020 --> 00:42.780
image is actually set.

00:42.780 --> 00:45.160
If it's not we will display something else.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.120
So let's ask this if statement.

00:49.620 --> 01:00.740
Now if there there is no image we display our normal header but if the reason image will wrap it with

01:00.740 --> 01:01.790
a div element

01:06.160 --> 01:11.970
and this div element will contain some individual style.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.400
So what we want to do is we want to add the background.

01:16.740 --> 01:22.450
So let's are the background to your URL.

01:23.630 --> 01:32.360
Now we'll have to echo post image your url.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.890
So here there will be a background

01:38.750 --> 01:48.040
and also when we close this h1 tag we will also have to check if post contains image.

01:48.230 --> 01:56.230
So normally you will just close this header.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.630
So this extra idea has to go hero

02:04.160 --> 02:10.280
but in case there is an image to be displayed with this we close the H1 element.

02:10.310 --> 02:16.100
But we also have to close the deal element that is basically optional here.

02:17.730 --> 02:17.970
OK.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.240
So maybe let's reformat it like that.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.200
So it's more readable what is happening.

02:24.290 --> 02:24.530
OK.

02:24.560 --> 02:30.410
That's not everything that we will do with style so we display this background as your URL.

02:30.410 --> 02:34.700
But we also want a minimum height of 500 pixels

02:37.740 --> 02:41.100
let's display the text are white to

02:43.820 --> 02:54.780
we want this to be aligned Center and the most important thing is background attachment so we want the

02:54.780 --> 02:57.840
background to stay when people are scrawling.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.190
You will see this effect in a second.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.790
So let's save the changes.

03:04.730 --> 03:11.840
You of course do not really have to retype all those styles and they can be found on the link attached

03:11.840 --> 03:15.220
to this lecture so you can check that out on github.

03:15.290 --> 03:22.190
If you make any mistakes now we'll also need some additional styling for the H1 element.

03:24.260 --> 03:35.300
So first we want padding top to be at least hundred pixels and we also want the text shadow because

03:35.300 --> 03:40.070
this text will now be shown on the background so it has to be visible

03:42.640 --> 03:44.080
so it is one pixel

03:47.380 --> 03:50.080
and the color of the shadow is black.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.900
OK now that's basically everything.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.940
So let's also remove this image tag save the changes.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.370
And now let's see how does it look like

04:10.990 --> 04:15.560
so apparently I've did something wrong when generating the URL.

04:15.560 --> 04:22.670
Let's verify that it's actually not background you URL is background image.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.710
So sorry for that.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.320
That's the correct name of the CSX property.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.160
So save the changes and to refresh.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.010
And this is what we have right now.

04:32.050 --> 04:37.320
And you can see when I am scrolling this background stays in the same place.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.690
So it's a nice effect.

04:38.710 --> 04:47.560
And this is thanks to the background attachment property if you will remove that then you get the defaults

04:48.190 --> 04:55.370
which is something like this.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.270
So now it stays in the same place.

04:57.270 --> 05:00.590
Now let's also check if other blog posts work.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.230
So the older one were that were generated with cedar.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.170
They do not have an image and you can see that.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.470
Now that title is displayed like it was before.

05:10.470 --> 05:15.810
So the default way back to when you have an image you can display it modern way.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.570
And then there is also text shadow.
