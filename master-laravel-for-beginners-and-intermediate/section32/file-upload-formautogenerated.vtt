Now let's proceed with implementing the first example that I mentioned in The Last Lecture which would

00:07.140 --> 00:11.510
be to upload an image together with a blog post.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.810
So we already have a forum for adding blog posts.

00:15.810 --> 00:23.610
But the important thing about making your forums be able to send files is you need to add up specific

00:23.610 --> 00:31.410
property to the forum tag which is ethnic type and the value of this has to be multipart form data.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.710
That's the value that has to be there.

00:34.770 --> 00:38.670
If you are trying to send any files.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.720
OK so this would be for the create forum.

00:41.730 --> 00:46.710
But we also have an update form where we modify the blog post.

00:46.710 --> 00:54.210
So this has to be added here to remember this property has to be added to all the forms which you use

00:54.600 --> 00:58.320
to submit files.

00:58.330 --> 01:10.590
Now we also need a field that the user can use to select a file from the disk and then upload it so

01:10.590 --> 01:15.220
we'll add some usual styling to our form.

01:15.240 --> 01:24.430
We can even copy the label and the input element so let's call this file thumbnail

01:28.930 --> 01:38.600
now in case of the files the type of the field is actually file the name could be thumbnail.

01:39.280 --> 01:46.240
Also in case of the files you wouldn't use the normal bootstrap foreign control but instead the phone

01:46.240 --> 01:55.730
control file and we do not have to provide any value OK so save the changes.

01:55.730 --> 01:59.620
And now let's see how this form looks like now.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.660
It also has the button that you can click and then pick a file from your disk.

02:04.670 --> 02:11.090
So this is basically all about preparing a forum to be able to upload the files in the next lecture

02:11.090 --> 02:16.970
will proceed with actually implementing some logic for the file uploads.
