00:00.580 --> 00:06.810
The last time we took a little time to actually make our application which is part of this chorus a

00:06.810 --> 00:10.140
little bit nicer by styling a little bit.

00:10.140 --> 00:16.740
Now let's go back to the most important thing which is learning how the travel works and how to do things

00:16.800 --> 00:18.060
with it.

00:18.060 --> 00:26.370
So we have a blog post that contains an image and we have added it by uploading our new image together

00:26.370 --> 00:27.890
with the blog post.

00:27.990 --> 00:37.890
But what we also have is our ability to edit images and then now we have the opportunity to edit blog

00:37.890 --> 00:41.520
post which already can contain an image.

00:41.520 --> 00:50.190
So when you will upload a new file for this blog post then you probably want to make sure that not only

00:50.190 --> 00:53.150
the path to the old file.

00:53.160 --> 00:59.460
Well to this relation because each blog post contains only one is updated but you will also like to

00:59.460 --> 01:07.560
delete the old file from the disk because this will no longer be stored inside the database so we need

01:07.560 --> 01:10.670
to delete files.

01:11.460 --> 01:20.190
So let's go to the post controller and update action because here we also have to handle an upload.

01:20.190 --> 01:24.840
So first let's copy the code that we have inside the store method.

01:26.500 --> 01:34.790
So we also will check if the request has file because we have this on both forms.

01:34.990 --> 01:45.630
Now we would also store the file and generate a new path for it but then we have to check if the Post

01:46.230 --> 01:47.280
has an image

01:50.490 --> 01:54.140
so if the Post has already an image.

01:54.210 --> 02:02.350
What we will do is we'll modify the image path to the new one.

02:02.350 --> 02:06.670
But before we do that we have to delete this old image.

02:06.670 --> 02:13.900
So again we are accessing the storage for Sade and it has our delete method.

02:14.530 --> 02:24.790
So before we store the new path on the image we should delete the old one like that now otherwise

02:28.090 --> 02:33.410
if the blog post didn't have an image we will store it as we did before.

02:33.460 --> 02:40.870
In this method the blog post actually is inside the post variable and of course after making this changes

02:40.900 --> 02:46.150
we will have to save the image and changes to it.

02:46.180 --> 02:55.060
Now the blog post is soft delectable which means it's not actually being deleted from the database but

02:55.200 --> 03:04.780
what you could also do in case it wasn't self debatable is in the events defined inside the boot method

03:04.810 --> 03:16.990
on the blog post you might define something like blog post image delete and then you will define also

03:17.360 --> 03:19.480
an event for the blog post.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.170
Sorry for the image model.

03:21.640 --> 03:29.290
And then on the image model you will define are deleting or delete that event and then on it you would

03:29.290 --> 03:31.900
be able to use storage delete.

03:31.900 --> 03:37.410
So now the image will just handle the image model will handle deleting itself.

03:37.420 --> 03:45.880
So whenever that image would be removed from the database it will also take care of removing the file

03:45.910 --> 03:47.010
itself.

03:47.440 --> 03:53.060
But since it is actually self to delete ABL we won't do that.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.540
So now let's verify if that works.

03:58.930 --> 04:06.790
So there is an image related to the blog post with Ida 50 free which happens to be this blog post.

04:06.790 --> 04:16.600
We are editing right now and you can see that it has this image starting with this string.

04:16.620 --> 04:25.620
So now let's make sure that this would be deleted so we can see that this file is actually inside the

04:25.740 --> 04:28.720
storage up public thumbnails.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.950
That starts with this particular name.

04:32.150 --> 04:38.750
It's also on the database and now if I modified the original blog post and upload a different image

04:39.320 --> 04:43.050
now you can see that this image is different.

04:44.600 --> 04:51.110
Also when we refresh the database you can see that there is still the same record which relates to this

04:51.110 --> 04:53.960
blog post but now the name is different.

04:55.500 --> 05:01.280
And also on the disk you can see that this imagine no longer is there and there is a new one.

05:01.290 --> 05:06.120
So this is how you would remove files using this storage for Sayed.
