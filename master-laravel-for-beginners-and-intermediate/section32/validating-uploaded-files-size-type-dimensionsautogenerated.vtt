00:00.960 --> 00:08.650
The last thing that we need to cover on uploading files is validating what is actually being uploaded.

00:09.300 --> 00:13.860
So let's try another example when we will submit a blog post.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.980
But this time we will send a text file.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.270
This is actually our real text file so if you do not have any you can just prepare one.

00:25.450 --> 00:33.580
Now what you can see here is there is no image but you can see that there is a link to the actual text

00:33.580 --> 00:43.420
file and worst thing is that it was actually being uploaded and we are trying to display this particular

00:43.540 --> 00:44.470
image.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.630
So it's obviously no good.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.050
We need to somehow validate that.

00:50.050 --> 00:57.870
Now inside the Update method and the store method we use the same request glass the store post.

00:58.090 --> 01:04.870
So let's open it now and there is no validation rule for the farm or any of field.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.270
So let's add it now.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.180
So fun.

01:07.180 --> 01:12.510
Nail no scenes that image is not required.

01:12.510 --> 01:20.270
We do not have to add the required validation but the most basic one we can add is image.

01:20.310 --> 01:29.700
So this will actually verify if the uploaded file is an image so let's try it another time.

01:30.010 --> 01:39.430
So provide some values that would work and try to upload a text file so this time you see that the front

01:39.450 --> 01:42.100
now must be an image.

01:42.100 --> 01:51.090
So now we do not allow users to upload anything else than image but also image can mean different things.

01:51.130 --> 02:01.130
So let's say we only want to allow users to upload a J pic file so the validator for this is called

02:01.160 --> 02:02.160
mimes.

02:02.210 --> 02:08.180
Let's specify j peg as the only type which can be uploaded.

02:08.180 --> 02:16.640
This will actually guess it on the mind type of the field file so it's not based on the extension.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.360
Save the changes.

02:18.650 --> 02:22.580
And now let's try to upload our PMG file.

02:22.580 --> 02:29.010
This is actually a small Avatar image so let's try it.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.970
And now you see that this cannot be uploaded.

02:34.030 --> 02:34.300
OK.

02:34.310 --> 02:44.190
So we might actually wants to allow users to upload PMG and even gifs or as G files.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.200
So this is fine.

02:45.200 --> 02:56.260
We just learned how to filter that but then we might not want users to upload files that are too big

02:57.410 --> 03:05.810
so you can do that by specifying the max validation rule the same as we did with the length of the text

03:05.810 --> 03:14.000
fields but in case of the files and in turn in case of images this is actually specifying the maximum

03:14.000 --> 03:16.720
size in kilobytes.

03:17.060 --> 03:24.180
So let's specify it as one megabyte and then we'll try to upload a bigger file.

03:24.260 --> 03:28.190
So this one seems to be bigger than one megabyte

03:32.050 --> 03:40.720
and now you see that the family may not be greater than one megabyte okay now.

03:41.140 --> 03:46.240
So we actually filter that this is an image of specific type.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.900
And that also the size is not bigger than one megabyte.

03:51.120 --> 03:58.650
But since this is actually a blog post and we have some rules that will make this blog post title with

03:58.650 --> 04:02.540
the hate of at least five hundred pixels.

04:02.700 --> 04:08.910
Let's make sure that the domain dimensions of this image are smaller than that.

04:09.240 --> 04:16.740
So to verify the dimensions of an image and notice does that this validator is only for images we can

04:16.740 --> 04:18.470
use it dimensions

04:20.970 --> 04:28.470
and now you can specify a couple of parameters so you can specify the minimum with the maximum width

04:28.560 --> 04:29.540
of an image.

04:29.550 --> 04:39.750
The minimum hate maximum hate exact with exact haIf or ratio and the ratio is there with divided by

04:39.870 --> 04:41.490
hate.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.620
So let's specify the first one.

04:43.620 --> 04:54.450
So we want dimensions and incited the minimum hate should be five hundred.

04:54.470 --> 04:58.720
Now let's try to upload a file which has different dimensions.

04:58.730 --> 05:01.010
So I have one prepared here.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.480
This is actually with the hate of a hundred 28 pixels

05:08.950 --> 05:18.450
and you can see that the family image has invalid image dimensions so alternatively you can also specify

05:18.450 --> 05:21.020
something like Marks hate.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.890
The same with with so minimum with maximum hate.

05:25.080 --> 05:30.340
Or if you need exact measurements you can do with hate.

05:30.360 --> 05:38.830
You can also combine them and finally there is ratio so ratio could be something like this.

05:38.880 --> 05:45.010
So the with should be free parts and hate two parts or other natively.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.290
You can specify it like that.

05:47.680 --> 05:56.060
So we've divided by hate would be to at least half the time line larger than it is.

05:56.270 --> 05:56.670
OK.

05:56.680 --> 06:03.340
So we only need the minimum height so let's keep it like that but just in case you would like to figure

06:03.340 --> 06:11.140
out more options that you have with the validation then obviously please check out the lot of documentation.

06:11.140 --> 06:15.950
It has a great page about all the possible options that you can use here.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.680
The link is included.
