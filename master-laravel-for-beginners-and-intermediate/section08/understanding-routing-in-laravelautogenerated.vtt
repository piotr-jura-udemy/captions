Let's try to explain what is rooting and how it works in a typical Laravel application.

00:07.440 --> 00:16.140
So starting from scratch, someone visits your website and then they are always directed into one single

00:16.650 --> 00:20.770
file, the index in a public folder.

00:21.390 --> 00:28.800
Yes, every single request to your Laravel application goes through this single file, which might be

00:28.800 --> 00:35.790
a little bit different to what you are used to if you ever developed applications before, where typically

00:36.000 --> 00:38.820
every page had a separate file.

00:41.070 --> 00:44.160
From this point on, the router component takes over.

00:44.670 --> 00:52.980
Its job is to understand the URL and decide what to do with it next, passing it to our controller.

00:55.200 --> 01:02.250
So first, you would have to define some routes you can define in routes that are static or dynamic,

01:02.730 --> 01:12.060
static means you just march on exact text like posts or dynamic, which means you much part of the text,

01:12.060 --> 01:14.820
but then part of the route can be dynamic.

01:14.850 --> 01:18.490
For example, it can accept different numbers as parameters.

01:19.230 --> 01:28.530
So in this example that we have here, post one router would decide that this route matches and then

01:28.950 --> 01:32.520
this would execute a specific code from our controller.

01:33.280 --> 01:40.110
We'll talk about what is the controller, but generally that is a piece of code that actually handles

01:40.110 --> 01:41.490
your request.

01:42.530 --> 01:49.370
The job of Rueter is to just pass the request to a specific controller and the job of controller is

01:49.370 --> 01:50.580
to generate a response.

01:51.530 --> 01:54.620
Well, basically, that's everything about rooting.
