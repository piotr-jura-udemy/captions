00:01.120 --> 00:06.520
This time, we will also talk about a routine, so make sure you have the development server started

00:06.520 --> 00:15.370
and browser directed at this local Eurail den in called Let's open the Web File with the Roots.

00:16.570 --> 00:19.860
So in this lecture, we will see two things.

00:20.200 --> 00:27.400
First, one is how to get the least of all the routes defined in your application so you can do that

00:27.400 --> 00:30.830
through the terminal, through an artisan command, actually.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.490
So let's open the terminal in VS code.

00:33.670 --> 00:36.240
I will use a shortcut control field.

00:36.460 --> 00:43.720
You can check for your system in the View menu terminal was the shortcut for opening the terminal inside.

00:43.810 --> 00:44.740
Very cold.

00:44.980 --> 00:49.930
So the command is speech artisan route Kolon.

00:49.930 --> 00:54.330
Least now this is how the list looks like currently.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.140
So it has some useful parameters.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.700
Now, if we would define another route, it should show up in here.

01:01.720 --> 01:09.660
So let me close the terminal so we can have another practice of defining a route.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.320
Let's define our contact route.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.200
This will be just a simple page, returning the text.

01:18.200 --> 01:18.950
Contact.

01:20.200 --> 01:26.590
Save the charges, let's go back to the browser and verify if this actually works during this.

01:29.390 --> 01:35.000
Now, going back to VSC cold, open the terminal again, using control Tilda.

01:36.400 --> 01:43.660
And running the artisan route, at least again, will now show our newly defined route.

01:45.640 --> 01:53.860
Not eased up, the name parameter of all of our routes is empty and actually having named routes is

01:53.860 --> 01:56.950
very useful whenever you need to generate.

01:56.950 --> 02:03.430
Are you around to certain page, let's say to this contact page, it's better to use some name you can

02:03.440 --> 02:11.440
remember instead of relying on the your URL that might easily change in the future to give you routes

02:11.440 --> 02:15.540
some name you might chain a call to unnamed method.

02:16.480 --> 02:24.820
For example, we can call those two routes, let's say home index, and the second one can be called

02:24.820 --> 02:26.320
home contact.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.420
This is how you give your routes names.

02:29.950 --> 02:37.150
Now, if you will run a bipartisan route list again, they all have names.

02:37.870 --> 02:43.360
So you want to immediately see the benefits of giving routes, names.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.300
We'll have to move forward a little bit with the course.

02:46.300 --> 02:51.670
But for now, I need you to trust me that this is the best practice.
