00:00.540 --> 00:05.450
This time, we will talk about optional parameters, but first let's talk about this one.

00:05.880 --> 00:11.620
So the parameter we've added last time to the route is by default are required parameter.

00:12.180 --> 00:19.510
What this means is this route to match it actually has to contain something after the second slash.

00:19.980 --> 00:24.810
So let me show you, if we go to the browser, this works perfectly.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.610
But if I remove the numbers, well, it won't match.

00:29.610 --> 00:31.980
We have 404 not found.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.600
Now, there is also a way to defined a so-called optional parameter so it can either be provided in

00:39.600 --> 00:41.250
the euro or not.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.420
So let's define such route.

00:43.440 --> 00:51.390
Again, we will use their route class starting gate method and we might want to have a route that will

00:51.390 --> 00:53.120
display recent posts.

00:53.670 --> 00:58.810
So a list of all the recent posts and it might have our parameter.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.820
And this would be an optional one called days ago.

01:05.250 --> 01:10.760
So you define an optional parameter exactly the same way as a required one.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.280
But at the end, you are the question mark.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.990
This marks an optional parameter.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.420
Now let's are the function.

01:22.850 --> 01:29.180
As I've said in the last lecture, the names of function arguments do not have to match the names of

01:29.180 --> 01:30.170
root parameters.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.700
That's why I can name it days ago.

01:34.400 --> 01:40.970
And in case with the optional parameters, you should provide a default to your function argument,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.960
as the name suggests, it's optional.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.530
So it might not be provided.

01:45.530 --> 01:49.110
It's good and actually it's necessary to have a default.

01:49.490 --> 01:52.050
So let's say maybe 20.

01:52.730 --> 02:04.670
Now what this root can do, I will just return some static text so it can be posts from I'll concatenate

02:04.670 --> 02:10.390
with days ago and days ago, something like this.

02:10.400 --> 02:18.620
So you might want to use optional root parameters when you want people to be able to specify an argument.

02:19.010 --> 02:26.090
Let's say they would like to see posts from last five days or the last 10 days, but you would like

02:26.090 --> 02:29.510
to have some default value right now.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.570
Let's verify how this works.

02:32.510 --> 02:39.560
So instead of posts, we would now go to resend sorry to recent dush posts.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.470
There it is.

02:40.790 --> 02:48.110
So now we have the default 20, but optionally I can specify a parameter and then it's actually five.

02:49.440 --> 02:55.400
Finally, as I've said a couple of lectures ago, it's a good practice to give all of your roots names.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.450
So let's start with this one.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.300
We will call it posts show.

03:00.840 --> 03:09.850
And this one this one will be called Posts Posts, Recent Index.

03:11.070 --> 03:15.470
Now, those names are not accidental, but I'll get to them later.

03:15.570 --> 03:15.900
Why?

03:15.900 --> 03:17.350
I called them this way.

03:17.670 --> 03:22.710
Finally, let's open the terminal and rerun bipartisan route least.

03:25.350 --> 03:30.600
And now you can see a couple of more routes that we have just defines together with their names.

03:30.930 --> 03:34.260
Of course, it takes a little bit more space.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.750
So I'll zoom out and we can see that clearly.
