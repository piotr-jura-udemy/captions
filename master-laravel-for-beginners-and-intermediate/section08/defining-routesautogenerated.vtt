00:01.560 --> 00:08.970
We will continue to explore the topic of looting this time there will be practical exercises to so make

00:08.970 --> 00:13.440
sure you have the code editor browser and terminal opened and ready.

00:14.880 --> 00:23.670
In Laravel, routes are defined inside the routes folder and a to file and a web BHP.

00:25.070 --> 00:31.400
Before we cover the existing code in those files or learn how to define the rules ourselves, let's

00:31.400 --> 00:37.280
first discuss why the separation for Web and Abib exists at all.

00:38.420 --> 00:44.990
So that's a long lasting Laravel convention, the separation is due to different requirements of normal

00:44.990 --> 00:51.900
Web pages and API responses, which typically return just to the data in the Jasen format.

00:52.460 --> 01:01.400
Now, typical websites rely on cookies and sessions, while APIs, on the other hand, might need some

01:01.400 --> 01:02.360
rate limiting.

01:04.310 --> 01:12.590
Let's see how we can define roots ourselves, so in this Web file, we have the root class imported.

01:13.510 --> 01:20.890
And we will use this ruling class to define routes now route class has some static methods, and those

01:20.890 --> 01:30.460
static method names corresponds to the HDP verb names like GED Post put PAF or delete.

01:32.190 --> 01:41.370
This static methods accept two parameters, the first one is the use of the route we are trying to march.

01:42.270 --> 01:46.630
The second one is the controller, now the controller.

01:47.040 --> 01:54.210
This can be either name of the method in a class or as you see here, an anonymous function.

01:56.430 --> 02:00.150
Let's also clarify what is this Urai parameter?

02:01.730 --> 02:05.660
It's everything that comes after your route, Domaine.

02:08.020 --> 02:15.070
The controller ultimate responsibility is to return some kind of response, this can be either the email

02:15.670 --> 02:17.590
plaintext or an match.

02:18.820 --> 02:25.780
Before we continue, let's head back to the terminal and make sure you have run this bipartisan self-command

02:25.780 --> 02:28.010
to start up development server.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.590
So when you visit this page, you should see something like this.

02:33.620 --> 02:42.290
Now it's time for our exercise, so let's modify what is being returned from this route, so instead

02:42.290 --> 02:45.380
of rendering this HTML that we see.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.720
Let's return some plaintext.

02:50.310 --> 02:52.420
This can be homepage.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.830
Saved the changes.

02:56.370 --> 03:02.430
And refresh this page, we can zoom in to see that this text was actually returned.
