WEBVTT

00:02.710 --> 00:10.480
BHP runs together with the Web server to run up cold, but it can also run scripts in their command

00:10.480 --> 00:10.870
line.

00:11.650 --> 00:19.750
Laravel has a huge spectrum of command line tools that can generate code, do maintains tasks or even

00:19.750 --> 00:22.570
start simple development web server.

00:23.640 --> 00:32.010
Installing Zamp is not enough to be able to use the command line, you need to add the path to the binary

00:32.010 --> 00:33.090
in your system.

00:33.420 --> 00:38.820
PAF Environment Variable Scenes Mako's Catharina Version 15.

00:39.390 --> 00:47.310
The default shell is that this age Vaastu configured their PAF variable for the current system user.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.530
You need to open the.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.110
Dot Zeta's H.

00:53.120 --> 01:00.910
Ursy file in your home folder that your old character is a shortcut to your home folder.

01:01.660 --> 01:07.650
Mark had previously used the Bosch by default to find out what show you use.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.350
Just check the title bar of the terminal up.

01:12.160 --> 01:21.490
It would say that this age or Bosch, if for some reason it says Bosch, the fire you need to open is

01:21.670 --> 01:25.000
the Bosch or instead.

01:26.370 --> 01:32.700
So open the correct file using our command line text editor called Nana.

01:34.120 --> 01:45.610
Shipped by default with the mark so type nano dot that is age HRC or nano bash Ursy depending on your

01:45.610 --> 01:46.240
cell.

01:49.650 --> 01:53.740
If you see an empty file when you run this command, it's fine.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.700
This file does not exist by default.

01:57.920 --> 02:06.110
If you see some text on the screen, as I do, it means you already had that fire in this case, you

02:06.110 --> 02:11.930
need to locate the line containing the text export perve.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.330
If you can't find it, it means it's not there, which is possible and is fine.

02:19.380 --> 02:25.080
You can use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate.

02:26.570 --> 02:31.490
The next step is to either align with export parv.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.880
Or locate the existing one.

02:37.010 --> 02:44.090
This variable defines system wide directories in which the system should look for executable programs,

02:44.940 --> 02:53.960
entries are separated using Kolon entries are entered from the left to right, which means those on

02:53.960 --> 02:55.970
the left have the highest priority.

02:57.330 --> 03:04.410
So the first entry should be applications, for example, been.

03:06.330 --> 03:13.620
At least when you've installed Zamp in this directory, which by default, you would notice that in

03:13.620 --> 03:18.970
my case I have other entries in this file, but you don't have to worry about that.

03:19.140 --> 03:27.090
Just make sure you have a line that says Export Parv and that there is the path to this bin folder inside

03:27.190 --> 03:29.490
Daxam folder and you will be fine.

03:30.390 --> 03:33.270
Next, press control all.

03:34.310 --> 03:39.140
To save changes, confirmed the file name by hitting enter.

03:40.170 --> 03:49.920
And then press control X to quit Nannerl or remember its control or control, X, not comment or comment

03:49.920 --> 03:50.370
X.

03:52.950 --> 03:57.110
Then you might have to restart your terminal, so please do it now.

03:58.100 --> 04:07.910
After restarting run baby dash there to check diversion, and if it works at all, you should see output

04:07.920 --> 04:13.320
similar to mine and also make sure their version matches the one you've downloaded.

04:13.970 --> 04:21.110
Sometimes people have previously installed BGB and may have some older versions dangling, which potentially

04:21.410 --> 04:23.090
might cause issues.
