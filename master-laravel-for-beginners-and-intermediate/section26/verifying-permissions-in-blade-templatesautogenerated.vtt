00:00.520 --> 00:08.470
Now after we have created a policy for a blog post you still see that we display the edit and delete

00:08.470 --> 00:10.900
buttons for everyone.

00:10.930 --> 00:17.240
Even though I am currently not authenticated at all you can see that on the right there is no user name

00:18.100 --> 00:26.440
and also if I will authenticate as let's say John Doe which in our current application is an admin.

00:26.440 --> 00:38.350
And even though I have temporarily disabled inside the provider that there is an override to the general

00:38.350 --> 00:43.530
rules that we have defined inside the policy for the blog post.

00:43.720 --> 00:52.390
He can still see the buttons to edit and delete posts that are not created by John Doe and this results

00:52.420 --> 00:55.300
in the 400 free page.

00:55.540 --> 01:03.070
So it depends if you'd like to show that this behavior to the user that when he clicked something he

01:03.070 --> 01:10.510
knows that he's not authenticated but probably some of the times you would like to just hide the buttons

01:10.510 --> 01:16.530
from the user if he is unable to actually perform this operation.

01:16.660 --> 01:21.870
So obviously we are covered here inside the larval blade template.

01:21.880 --> 01:34.030
So what I opened here is the index blade BHP from within views posts folder and here those two things

01:34.120 --> 01:40.060
you can see is first one is the edit button and the second one is the delete button.

01:40.090 --> 01:48.610
Now we can verify user permissions from within Lara blade as we would inside the controllers so we can

01:48.610 --> 01:51.150
use that can directive.

01:51.460 --> 01:58.810
And now that we have defined our policy and registered the policy using our provider.

01:58.840 --> 02:03.060
So let's go to the ALF provide our service provider for a second.

02:03.070 --> 02:11.770
So as we have defined that there is a blog post policy inside this particular policy class.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.580
And of course the abilities are the method names.

02:15.580 --> 02:24.010
Now we can do what we did inside controller so we can check whether the current user can update the

02:24.010 --> 02:24.610
post

02:30.150 --> 02:36.710
and we have to close this directive using and can now we can do the same for the delete button.

02:36.750 --> 02:46.940
So we right can delete post and we close that by and can.

02:46.950 --> 02:53.550
So you can see it's extremely simple and even you can read this code as you would be reading a normal

02:53.550 --> 02:54.260
language.

02:54.270 --> 02:56.250
It really makes sense.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.740
So we are checking if someone can update a post.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.260
So there is.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.070
It's extremely verbose.

03:02.070 --> 03:04.970
It's very clear what is happening here.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.990
So save this changes.

03:07.030 --> 03:10.020
And now let's go to our blog post least.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.010
So now you can see I do not see any buttons.

03:14.070 --> 03:21.060
I only see buttons below the posts that were actually actually created by John Doe.

03:21.120 --> 03:25.010
So to further verify that it actually works.

03:25.020 --> 03:33.180
Let's go back to our our service provider and let's enable back for a second hour override our gate

03:33.210 --> 03:40.320
check interception to give every user that is an admin an ability to update their post.

03:40.320 --> 03:49.600
So this is what we have did before save the changes and now refresh this page while it didn't work.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.930
And the reason is because we haven't updated the name of the ability.

03:55.930 --> 04:05.250
So we previously have changed that to the posts update where we should actually modify its name because

04:05.250 --> 04:06.590
now it is just update.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.110
So let's modify that and refresh again.

04:10.110 --> 04:20.640
So now since John Doe is an admin we are authenticated as John Doe we can edit all the posts but we

04:20.640 --> 04:29.910
can only delete our own now if we would also give admins ability to delete everything like so we should

04:29.910 --> 04:32.250
be able to edit and delete everything

04:35.660 --> 04:41.250
now there is also another great directive we can use.

04:41.250 --> 04:45.670
So other than can we can use cannot.

04:45.910 --> 04:51.070
So it is just an opposite to what Ken is doing so we can check.

04:51.070 --> 05:00.030
Cannot let's say cannot delete post and cannot.

05:00.090 --> 05:04.190
So here will be able to display something like you.

05:05.220 --> 05:08.160
You can't delete this post.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.500
Let's see if that would work.

05:15.440 --> 05:23.230
So first we'll have to remove the delete ability from the admin abilities save the changes.

05:23.450 --> 05:27.340
And now you see this message that you cannot you can't delete this post.

05:27.860 --> 05:32.000
So obviously displaying a message like that doesn't make any sense.

05:31.990 --> 05:39.800
So I will just comment that out but just in case you will ever need to do that you will know how to

05:39.830 --> 05:44.300
make this checks inside the larval blade templates.
