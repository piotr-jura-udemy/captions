In the last two lectures you have seen how can you use gates to create authorization constraints and

00:07.020 --> 00:14.930
then check if certain user can't perform specific action by using gate denies FISA the method.

00:14.940 --> 00:19.560
And also we have used the outer Rice helper to simplify this for us.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.180
Now let's run.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.340
Peach bee artisan Tinker.

00:23.400 --> 00:36.140
Inside the terminal and let's see how can we check if our specific user that we specify is able to perform

00:36.190 --> 00:38.120
a specific action.

00:38.180 --> 00:44.630
So what we have here is our blog post list and we have terminal on the right.

00:44.660 --> 00:51.810
So first we'll list all the users that we have inside the database by calling user.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.070
All right.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.830
Now we see some users on the right.

00:55.840 --> 01:02.170
Basically we have all of the users from our database and we see blog posts.

01:02.270 --> 01:10.250
So when you will hover under the on this title on the bottom of this browser page you can see the I.D.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.690
of this blog post and this particular one happens to have the I.D. 17.

01:16.700 --> 01:23.990
So remember what I.D. your blog post has because of obviously it might be different on your machine.

01:23.990 --> 01:30.590
This one has I.D. 17 and we'll verify that for other user than this one.

01:30.620 --> 01:38.370
So it is our data log Reinhold and let's find here a user that has a different idea like we.

01:38.370 --> 01:41.760
I will use Ty Rick Cummings.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.760
So first I will fetch this user using the user model.

01:46.790 --> 01:56.330
Find a method with the I.D. 21 so I have it here and then I will fetch the blog post so blog post find

01:56.740 --> 02:03.500
and I will use that I.D. 17 the one that you can see by hovering over the blog post.

02:03.710 --> 02:11.180
So I am making sure that I am fetching a blog post that is being outlawed by different user than this

02:11.180 --> 02:11.610
one.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.330
OK.

02:13.460 --> 02:15.490
So far so good.

02:15.500 --> 02:24.170
Now let's clear the screen and see what can we do with gates so we can use the gate file for seed inside

02:24.260 --> 02:34.040
the lateral thinker and to check if certain user can perform an action on this particular gate we can

02:34.040 --> 02:36.140
use for user.

02:36.800 --> 02:43.550
And here you will have to pass the instance of the model of the user that we have fetch which had a

02:43.550 --> 02:50.080
name Dereck and then we can do what we did before.

02:50.080 --> 02:59.830
So we can call denies let's for example check if this particular user is well can't edit a blog post

03:00.880 --> 03:08.380
so we'll pass the instance of the post and you can see that it returns true which means that this user

03:08.380 --> 03:13.200
cannot edit this blog post but it's not all.

03:13.300 --> 03:18.650
So we can check it for particular user also using that allows method.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.260
So it's just opposite of denies.

03:21.260 --> 03:28.240
It's just depends what you will have to do in your code are to one particular place and what would make

03:28.240 --> 03:30.320
more sense.

03:30.430 --> 03:39.400
So we are just basically calling the same thing but using allows and you can see that it returned false.

03:40.360 --> 03:49.090
So when you need to check not if the currently authenticated user can do something but whether a specific

03:49.090 --> 03:58.570
user can do something you can use this for a user and also it's good to remember that the gate I say

03:58.590 --> 04:06.100
does not only contain that the nice method which checks if certain user can't do something but it also

04:06.100 --> 04:11.470
contains the allows method which checks if the user can do something.
