00:00.420 --> 00:07.680
Now to conclude our section about outer ization let's do some work on the contact page.

00:07.770 --> 00:16.050
So what we will do in this lecture is we have the simple contact page which just displays one paragraph.

00:16.440 --> 00:24.390
So what we would like to do is we will like to add a link to another page which would contain some detailed

00:24.390 --> 00:28.630
contact information like an email or a phone.

00:28.920 --> 00:37.500
And we want this page to look like this for anyone who has not authenticated but for authenticated users

00:37.530 --> 00:39.980
that are for example admins.

00:40.170 --> 00:48.000
We would like to display a link to the special contact page and also we would like to protect this special

00:48.000 --> 00:54.780
control page from anyone that is not authenticated and not an admin.

00:54.780 --> 01:00.530
So that seems like a use case that you might have in your application.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.360
So let's first start with our our service provider.

01:05.370 --> 01:12.180
So as we have introduced the blog post policy class you might think that you should use policies for

01:12.180 --> 01:13.160
everything.

01:13.350 --> 01:17.940
But we talked about that before and that's obviously not the case.

01:17.940 --> 01:26.790
So policies are used best when you have a resource or a model that you want to specify some abilities

01:26.910 --> 01:31.420
rights permissions for that particular resource or model.

01:32.130 --> 01:38.300
But using Gates is just perfectly fine you might define them for any other cases.

01:38.310 --> 01:48.370
That seems to be like a global to your application or basically they do not relate to any specific model.

01:48.400 --> 01:56.250
Now we will define a gate that will protect this resource which is our special contact page.

01:56.740 --> 02:06.430
So we'll define it as contact or maybe we have com controller so we can even use home secret.

02:06.430 --> 02:10.200
So that's the name of our new gate.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.430
Then it will receive a callback.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.360
So the first argument is always on user you never have to pass it when you verify permissions.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.190
And then there are additional arguments if you provide them.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.590
So when you check for permissions you should provide those arguments.

02:26.590 --> 02:29.980
But if you don't have any you don't have to do that.

02:29.980 --> 02:30.790
So that's enough.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.220
That's the simplest gate.

02:33.220 --> 02:38.740
So since we won't be checking for any models we do not have any more arguments.

02:38.740 --> 02:47.150
Now we can just simply return whatever the user is admin and that's it.

02:47.170 --> 02:49.650
That's our gate.

02:49.720 --> 02:56.830
Now let's go to the view which shows the contact page which can be found inside the views folder.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.710
That's this one contact the blade BHP.

03:00.250 --> 03:08.750
What we can immediately do is we can use what we learned in the previous lecture so we can use the can

03:08.750 --> 03:10.070
directive.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.560
So the gate name is home.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.340
Secret

03:19.200 --> 03:21.600
and here we can display our special link

03:26.320 --> 03:30.460
so we haven't we don't have a route for this special link yet.

03:30.490 --> 03:35.090
So we just we'll just display text to verify that.

03:35.170 --> 03:38.710
Let's go back to our application and see if that works

03:43.480 --> 03:47.560
apparently I've misspelled the name of the class.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.300
So it's gate and not gate sorry for that.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.710
Let's fix that quickly and refresh.

03:53.710 --> 04:00.280
Now you can see that we see this text special contact details because we are out integrated as John

04:00.280 --> 04:05.540
Doe which is an account for an admin in our system.

04:05.590 --> 04:10.620
So if you log out you can see that on the contact page you won't see anything.

04:10.630 --> 04:17.350
Also if you will try to log in as one of the other users you have inside the database from the cedar.

04:17.350 --> 04:21.220
Remember that the password for all of them is secret.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.230
You can see that you want see this special link.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.610
So let's log in again as John Doe go to the contact page.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.410
And now let's open our Controller.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.050
So we have our home controller by the way.

04:37.150 --> 04:41.660
You can actually remove this action we are not using it anymore.

04:41.950 --> 04:46.160
And also we can ditch this old blog post template.

04:46.180 --> 04:54.110
So let's remove it altogether now will define a method to show this secret page.

04:54.130 --> 05:01.360
Let's call it secret and it will simply return a View called secret

05:05.060 --> 05:09.070
and now you should create a new template inside the views folder.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.080
So let's go ahead and do that.

05:11.090 --> 05:19.900
This would be secret blade BHP and this could be copied from the contract because this would basically

05:19.900 --> 05:26.160
extend the layout and show some additional information.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.990
Of course we do not need this can directive here.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.840
So this is secret e-mail secret.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.360
Lara test.

05:39.490 --> 05:47.570
All right so this is our secret page now we do not use our resource controller and it won't work anyway

05:47.590 --> 05:49.120
for our home controller.

05:49.120 --> 05:56.140
So let's go to Web BHP where we are defining our routes.

05:56.470 --> 06:01.680
Now we have two routes defined using our home controller.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.310
First one is the home one.

06:03.310 --> 06:06.170
And the second one is contact.

06:06.190 --> 06:10.290
Now let's define another one for our secret page.

06:10.360 --> 06:22.270
So this will be get secret and the controller is home controller method name is secret name would also

06:22.270 --> 06:26.170
be secret.

06:26.260 --> 06:31.080
And here's another thing we will do so we'll protect this.

06:31.260 --> 06:39.990
You are all together the same way we did that with when we applied the middleware out for our home controller.

06:40.030 --> 06:47.500
We just did that to show you how we can protect certain URL that users that are not authenticated cannot

06:47.500 --> 06:50.530
visit this URL at all.

06:50.530 --> 06:58.930
And what we will do now is will do the same thing with secret just that users that are not out integrated

06:59.020 --> 07:05.920
well in this case it won't be about if the user is authenticated or not but whether he is an admin or

07:05.980 --> 07:06.760
he isn't

07:09.780 --> 07:19.410
so will add middleware to this route media were using middleware method and what we can do is we can

07:19.410 --> 07:27.060
use our can and middleware can middleware works exactly the same as you would use it inside for example

07:27.160 --> 07:33.510
larval blade directive it is using the larval alteration system.

07:33.510 --> 07:40.980
And now what you can do is the first argument should be the name of the ability in our case is home

07:41.070 --> 07:42.480
secret.

07:42.480 --> 07:48.000
And then additionally using commerce you can specify another parameter.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.840
So for example if you would like this to protect root that for example is related to a model let's say

07:57.840 --> 08:07.110
a post you would be able to do something like post update and post and posting this case would be the

08:07.110 --> 08:16.890
name of the root parameter like we have inside our roots for editing deleting posts but we are doing

08:16.950 --> 08:23.580
a simpler case this time I will show you the more complicated cases later in this course but now we

08:23.580 --> 08:27.540
just need to check for home secret.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.800
That's it.

08:28.920 --> 08:35.540
Now we are protecting this secret page so no one who is an admin won't be able to visit it.

08:35.610 --> 08:43.880
The final thing to do is on our contact page we need to display a link so let's do that.

08:43.880 --> 08:50.630
We did that couple of times before so you should already know how to do that but you of course have

08:50.630 --> 09:00.180
to put a link then we'll echo our route using root function and the root name is secret

09:05.990 --> 09:08.080
and basically that's it.

09:08.090 --> 09:14.600
Let's also change the label to go to special contact details.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.950
And this is basically it.

09:15.950 --> 09:26.570
Now let's refresh the page and since I am an admin I can go to the secret page so you can see I as an

09:26.570 --> 09:28.600
admin was able to do that.

09:28.610 --> 09:33.480
Now let's go to the other is bar and copy the URL.

09:33.500 --> 09:40.730
Now let's log out and try to paste this page so we can see that we are unable to visit it that you can

09:40.730 --> 09:47.090
see that we have the 400 free that we are on to rise to do that.

09:47.090 --> 09:54.000
Now let's also go ahead and log in as someone else for example I have this Ahlam heels so I will log

09:54.010 --> 09:54.720
our logging.

09:54.740 --> 10:01.100
Ask her remember that you only need to use if you use the default seating logic that I've shown you

10:01.100 --> 10:08.420
only in the email that password is always secret but it will be different in your database us as you

10:08.420 --> 10:20.190
know it is being randomly generated so let's logging us this lady password is secret we can even save

10:20.190 --> 10:20.480
it.

10:20.550 --> 10:28.170
Now we can see we are Arlan hills and if you go to contact page you can see that you are unable to see

10:28.170 --> 10:30.360
the link to the special contact page.

10:30.360 --> 10:35.550
It is only for admins and obviously we can't visit that link.
