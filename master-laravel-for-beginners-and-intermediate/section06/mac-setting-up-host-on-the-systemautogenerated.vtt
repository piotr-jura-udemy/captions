Configuring the local domain on your computer is super easy in the terminal type pseudo nano ATC hosts.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.130
And type your password when asked.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.600
On the left, you need to type 127 oh.

00:24.370 --> 00:32.110
Oh, one, which is your localhost IP address and on the right, separated by any number of spaces,

00:32.110 --> 00:33.310
type the domain name.

00:34.270 --> 00:37.270
This would be Laravel Dot Test.

00:40.050 --> 00:47.130
Now, control, oh, will save the changes you need to confirm the filename, so yes, hit enter and

00:47.130 --> 00:50.670
then control X will quit the ED.

00:53.490 --> 00:59.670
You should be able to visit the Laravel dot test in the browser and see the Laravel project page, but

01:00.120 --> 01:03.870
if you don't see it, try running this command in the terminal.

01:04.170 --> 01:12.360
It is pseudo DNS cache, util, dash, flash cache.

01:13.320 --> 01:19.800
It will flash their DNS cache off your system and should help also make sure you have restarted the

01:19.800 --> 01:24.900
Apache server after making the virtual host config changes.

01:26.490 --> 01:33.120
It might happen that when you would go on Laravel dot test to test your website, you would see this

01:33.120 --> 01:34.290
permission error.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.560
Well, don't worry about that.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.410
It happens to fix this.

01:39.420 --> 01:49.270
Just go to your application folder in the terminal and just run this command pseudo h mod dash, big

01:49.290 --> 01:54.900
error, 777 storage slash da.

01:55.050 --> 01:59.910
Well, this will basically fix the file permission issues that you might be having.

02:00.330 --> 02:04.620
You would need to confirm with the password as this is an admin command.

02:07.300 --> 02:11.990
Now refresh, and there it is, the Laravel Project, welcome page.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.500
So everything is running correctly.
