To be able to visit your project on your local computer under a custom domain like Laravel, the test,

00:08.700 --> 00:13.800
you need to configure a so-called virtual host in the Apache Web server.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.470
It is not complicated at all.

00:18.060 --> 00:22.800
You need to go to the applications folder and then Zamp.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.250
Some files.

00:26.990 --> 00:27.740
EDC.

00:29.330 --> 00:38.720
And then open the http d dot com file, you can drag it onto the visual studio code icon in the dark.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.750
Next press, come on, Tev, and search for the hosts.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.600
There should only be one entry in this file.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.740
It should take you around line four eight eight.

00:58.220 --> 01:05.600
And command this line by removing the harsh character from the beginning of the line, this makes Apache

01:05.600 --> 01:11.960
use their separate file that contains the virtual host config, save the changes.

01:15.220 --> 01:24.160
Now we need to open this V hosts file, so go to the extra folder and locate HDTV codes dot com and

01:24.160 --> 01:26.200
drag it to the visual studio called.

01:27.400 --> 01:34.060
There are two example conflicts in there, and we will modify one, so let's do it with this one first,

01:34.210 --> 01:36.370
remove the first line, we won't need that.

01:36.610 --> 01:43.060
And then you need to set the document routes to punch to the folder where your application is.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.840
And server name is the domain name you will use.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.030
Let's start with the domain.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.300
So we want that to be Laravel.

01:53.950 --> 02:00.550
Those test, let's also fix the layers, so it's w w w Laravel to test.

02:01.840 --> 02:09.150
Then you need to specify the document route and it has to point to the folder where you have just created

02:09.150 --> 02:10.820
the new Laravel application.

02:11.530 --> 02:18.130
So if you followed the instructions, this would be applications slash sump, slash clunk sound files,

02:18.460 --> 02:20.470
then HD docs.

02:23.580 --> 02:31.620
Lot of public, it is public because in the public folder, you can find the index Buerge be filed the

02:31.620 --> 02:34.410
main entry points to the Laravel application.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.370
Additionally, you can give the error log and custom log files, names that are specific to our site

02:41.370 --> 02:44.370
name so they can be easily found in the logs folder.

02:46.110 --> 02:51.690
So a specific name would, for example, be Laravel to Test and Laravel.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.000
The first access log.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.320
Next, saved the changes and go back to the subpanel.

03:04.880 --> 03:12.620
Restart Apache to apply the new configuration while you are done to actually use the domain.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.780
You need to configure it locally on your system and there is a separate lecture about that.
