00:00.960 --> 00:07.540
In the last lecture we created the association between the outdoors and the profiles.

00:07.540 --> 00:12.560
And in this lecture I will show you how we can read that relation.

00:12.600 --> 00:21.930
So first let's start by loading one out or using the Find method so maybe let's try with the outer.

00:21.930 --> 00:29.460
We find you one and what you see is being automatically returned by Lara though is only the fields that

00:29.700 --> 00:32.250
belong to the outer.

00:32.250 --> 00:39.930
So that's a very important thing to know that by default Lavell won't be loading from the database all

00:39.930 --> 00:42.550
the relations of of the model.

00:42.650 --> 00:50.820
You'll have to explicitly load them and how you can do that is to remember that we have the relation

00:50.820 --> 00:55.350
defined US profile methods on the outer model.

00:55.350 --> 01:03.480
But now if you would instead call it as a field which doesn't exist we haven't defined it explicitly

01:03.480 --> 01:04.330
anywhere.

01:04.470 --> 01:12.990
It is just the way larval works that if it will find a field name which has the same name as the method

01:13.230 --> 01:22.440
name of this relation it will use the BHP dynamic capabilities to fetch this related model from the

01:22.440 --> 01:23.100
database.

01:23.130 --> 01:31.440
So now if I press enter only then the La Belle will fetch this relation so you can see that now it shows

01:31.440 --> 01:38.490
me the profile and I did that only by typing the profile as a property.

01:38.520 --> 01:44.100
And now let's see what outer contains so after I've read that profile.

01:44.280 --> 01:53.370
Now the outer model has the I.D. the timestamps and also the profile property which is which contains

01:53.400 --> 02:04.690
the profile model so we can do the same with profiles and load the out or from the other side so let's

02:04.690 --> 02:13.180
clear this and see what profiles do we have so maybe we can load the profile with the IDA five.

02:13.190 --> 02:20.710
Of course this could be different on your setup so just check out what's inside the database and we

02:20.710 --> 02:26.810
will use that profile find method and load the profile with the number five.

02:27.980 --> 02:35.690
So what you can see here is the idea the timestamps and the outer I.D. And of course this works the

02:35.690 --> 02:43.560
other way to that if I will use the outer property on the profile model.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.750
And this is exactly how we have called our relation.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.120
So there is an outer method on the profile model.

02:51.120 --> 02:59.320
It will load the related outer and let us see the profile right now after I use this property.

02:59.340 --> 03:06.900
So each time you use it read it then it just only then makes the query to fetch the related model.

03:06.900 --> 03:16.620
Now this is how profile looks like and it also has this outdoor property with the outer model so this

03:16.740 --> 03:25.490
concept of not loading everything at once is called lazy loading you will come across this term a lot

03:25.920 --> 03:34.140
and basically it is load only the things that you need at the time and lazy loading is by default inside

03:34.140 --> 03:37.520
the larval eloquent models.

03:37.560 --> 03:45.480
Now if you would like to load an outer but you want it to be loaded immediately with the profile with

03:45.750 --> 03:52.830
let's say one query you can also do that maybe let's stop Tinker and restart it.

03:53.520 --> 04:02.840
So we won't have anything loaded and now if you would like to load the outer with the specific idea

04:02.840 --> 04:06.570
and also work that profile there is another way to do it.

04:06.650 --> 04:11.690
So instead of find we'll start with using their width method.

04:12.290 --> 04:19.470
And here you have to specify the relation name so this would be profile so not the method name but the

04:19.470 --> 04:28.430
relation name would be the method name without parentheses and now we could we have to use another method

04:28.430 --> 04:39.260
called where key where we specify what primary key we want to fetch this record by and what will this

04:39.260 --> 04:47.480
return is actually are instance of the eloquent query builder and we haven't talked about query builders

04:47.510 --> 04:52.400
yet we will soon after the section about relations.

04:52.400 --> 04:58.310
But now let's try to just load it without with the profile.

04:58.340 --> 05:04.430
So we stopped at were key and to actually execute this query.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.940
We had to call for example first.

05:06.950 --> 05:13.520
So it will fetch the first element from the query result which would be a collection.

05:13.520 --> 05:18.070
So we do not want a collection we only want one record.

05:18.110 --> 05:25.980
And the method first is allowing us to pick the first result from the collection.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.430
Apparently I've misspelled that.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.430
So let's try again.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.020
I will just copy that

05:36.640 --> 05:37.680
and fix it.

05:37.750 --> 05:41.350
Now we're a key one.

05:41.470 --> 05:50.350
And first Okay so you can see that we have fetched the out or together with profile.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.830
By this simple query.

05:53.820 --> 06:00.930
Now if you think that this just came out of nowhere this part specifically this part with were key.

06:00.940 --> 06:10.080
And first let's go to the Vicky page and here I am mentioning that the model find is actually a shortcut

06:10.390 --> 06:18.310
so click this view source and you will be taken directly to the source code of Lavell inside GitHub

06:19.060 --> 06:23.230
and you can see how the find method looks like how it was implemented.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.890
And this is exactly what it is doing.

06:25.960 --> 06:31.480
It's calling their work key and getting the first result.

06:31.600 --> 06:41.830
Now the outer only has a relation to profile but if you would like to load more than one related entities

06:41.980 --> 06:49.450
let's say that the outer might have profile might have some favorite books or blog posts then you can

06:49.510 --> 06:58.680
also do something like this so it's inside the with method you will maybe specify not one relation but

06:58.710 --> 07:01.560
two or more relations inside an array.

07:01.590 --> 07:08.080
So assuming the recent comments relation which we don't have right now but let's just assume we do.

07:08.430 --> 07:16.080
You will also be able to do something like this and then it will load the outer together with the profile

07:16.230 --> 07:24.330
and the comments relation of course it doesn't work because we don't have the comments relation on the

07:24.330 --> 07:25.910
outer model.

07:26.100 --> 07:32.430
So this is how you can simply load the model at once together with its relations.

07:32.430 --> 07:37.530
And now let's continue to the next lectures when we will talk more about the relations.
