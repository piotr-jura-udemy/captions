00:01.350 --> 00:10.210
Now that we have our profile and our models created and migrations run let's open the terminal and large

00:10.210 --> 00:17.440
it's a little bit and let's start playing around with our one to one relation using thinker.

00:17.460 --> 00:24.300
So Ron peach bee artisan thinker into the terminal and let's see what we can do.

00:24.330 --> 00:30.710
So first we will create a new outer model.

00:30.920 --> 00:39.230
We will save it mind that I am using the does the outer class name without the app.

00:39.250 --> 00:39.860
Perfect.

00:39.870 --> 00:46.530
So if your version of Tinker doesn't like this you will have to type new app slash outer.

00:47.010 --> 00:51.770
Okay so we have our outdoor we can see the contents of it.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.390
It is stored inside the database with the I.D. one.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.860
Now let's create a new profile model.

01:00.140 --> 01:07.860
So we create a new instance of the profile the profile doesn't have anything yet because we haven't

01:07.860 --> 01:08.630
started.

01:08.670 --> 01:14.280
And the ideas and times times are assigned at the time when it is stored.

01:14.310 --> 01:21.960
Now if we have an out or and we want to assign our profile to it to it and maybe like in our case the

01:21.960 --> 01:24.360
profile is not yet saved.

01:24.420 --> 01:32.700
What we can do is we can access the profile as a method so that the outer has the profile method.

01:33.090 --> 01:36.630
You can see that here the profile method.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.250
Now let's see what this profile method would return.

01:39.270 --> 01:49.220
So it returns an object of type has one and to assign a profile to an out or will use this objects safe

01:49.260 --> 01:52.350
method to which you will have to find.

01:52.470 --> 02:00.270
You will have to pass the actual profile model so let's call it and you can see that the result of that

02:00.300 --> 02:04.280
is the new profile model which happens to have idea free.

02:04.380 --> 02:13.450
And it also has the outer I.D. automatically assigned with the value of one which happens to be the

02:13.450 --> 02:16.830
I.D. of the out or that we assign it to.

02:16.840 --> 02:22.910
Now let's check the database and you can see that the profile is being saved i.e. free and the outer

02:22.920 --> 02:23.290
I.D..

02:23.290 --> 02:26.650
Here is one.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.350
Now let's see how we can assign them the other way.

02:30.370 --> 02:37.630
So this time we want assign profile to the outer but we'll assign outer to the profile.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.870
So let's create a new instance of the profile.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.760
We can even assign it to the same variable names that we used.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.740
So it's not saved yet.

02:47.080 --> 02:51.880
And now let's create out or using this static create method.

02:51.880 --> 02:59.260
It does the same that like you would create first in the new instance of the outer and then call save

03:00.900 --> 03:09.450
so you can see it ultimately saved this outer and now the outer the sorry the profile has the outer

03:09.450 --> 03:15.470
method which is the relation and this relation is belongs to.

03:15.510 --> 03:18.980
So it also has a method called associate.

03:20.310 --> 03:26.720
And that way you can associate an outer to the profile and then you'll have to call save on it.

03:28.120 --> 03:38.530
So it is true so let's see what this profile contains and you can see that the new outer idea of free

03:38.560 --> 03:45.570
was assigned to this profile to verify that we can see what was the idea on the outer it was free.

03:45.920 --> 03:52.060
And now let's check also the database so you can see that we have two profiles assigned to different

03:52.150 --> 03:52.930
outers

03:55.930 --> 03:58.900
case so far so good.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.310
Now I will show you the third way to do it.

04:01.340 --> 04:06.090
So let's first clear the screen.

04:06.090 --> 04:09.990
So let's create another instance of the profile

04:12.710 --> 04:17.680
and now maybe we'll also create another outer.

04:17.750 --> 04:22.910
So we use out or create.

04:22.910 --> 04:28.130
So we have the outer created and already stored inside the database.

04:28.130 --> 04:30.890
Now we see that the outer I.D. is for.

04:30.890 --> 04:39.080
And as I've told you this relation is basically existing because of the outer I.D. column on the profile

04:39.080 --> 04:39.720
model.

04:40.520 --> 04:48.350
So we have our profile and we can directly access this outer I.D. so it doesn't do anything magical.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.760
It's not like that.

04:49.760 --> 05:00.160
Lara Val can only be used to manage relations using the associate or the say.

05:00.200 --> 05:09.110
The problem the safe method on the relation on the outer model you can directly modify the column that

05:09.320 --> 05:17.200
is basically holding the whole relation so we can assign therefore as the I.D. of the outer into the

05:17.210 --> 05:18.980
profile.

05:18.980 --> 05:22.760
Now let's see how the profile looks like.

05:22.760 --> 05:34.060
And if I was saved a profile it also works so the profile has the outer I.D. of for

05:36.770 --> 05:40.840
and you can see that this relations exists inside the database.

05:40.850 --> 05:47.630
And then you will be able to properly fetch that relation using Lara either in the next lecture.

05:47.630 --> 05:51.260
But now let's also try one more thing.

05:51.770 --> 05:57.550
So we have free outdoors and free profiles.

05:57.920 --> 06:02.340
So maybe we can fetch one of the profiles that we had before.

06:02.380 --> 06:05.640
Maybe the one with the I.D. free.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.270
So let's do that.

06:08.390 --> 06:17.900
We'll assign it to the profile variable using the Find static find method of the profile model.

06:17.900 --> 06:28.610
So we had that and now we'll try to assign the outer I.D. to that profile which would be something that

06:28.670 --> 06:30.830
is already inside the database.

06:30.830 --> 06:41.420
So we want to modify this to be let's say for so that outdoor I.D. We want to set it to four

06:44.330 --> 06:53.280
and now let's try to save changes to the profile model and now what you can see is that integrity constraint

06:53.350 --> 06:55.350
vote violation.

06:55.390 --> 07:01.900
And it says that there is a duplicate entry for for the key and that's the foreign key that we have

07:01.900 --> 07:02.470
defined.

07:02.470 --> 07:13.270
So it is preventing us to assign the same profile to two or more outer rows inside the outers database

07:13.570 --> 07:22.240
on the database level because well we wanted one to one relation and this is how we can protect ourselves

07:22.510 --> 07:32.620
in the database level from assigning more than one model on the one to one relation.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.190
Also let's try one more thing.

07:35.260 --> 07:37.510
So we'll create another profile

07:40.070 --> 07:44.580
and now we want assign outer I.D. in any way.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.930
And let's try to save it.

07:48.060 --> 07:53.640
So you see another error that the field outer I.D. doesn't have a default value.

07:53.880 --> 07:59.430
And since this is foreign key it really has to have value.

07:59.430 --> 08:07.020
So one thing is that this value has to be unique across the tables so there can't be two records with

08:07.020 --> 08:15.060
the same outdoor I.D. but also you cannot save a profile without a signed out or because it just cannot

08:15.060 --> 08:16.650
live on itself.

08:18.410 --> 08:18.700
OK.

08:18.710 --> 08:24.500
That would be it about the creating the relation in the next lecture.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.700
We will see how we can fetch those those relations from the models.

08:28.700 --> 08:35.320
So we'll see how we can fetch that profile by having an outdoor model and the vice versa.

08:35.360 --> 08:42.220
Of course you can also read the more detailed examples on the Vicki page that the link for is included

08:42.230 --> 08:43.130
to this lecture.
