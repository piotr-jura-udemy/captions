In the last lecture we worked on our simple end point returning some data as Jason and we talked about

00:08.730 --> 00:17.100
some fields that are returned but we don't necessarily want them such as commendable type 4 for example.

00:17.640 --> 00:27.360
So let's go to the Visual Studio code or we can close these classes and as an example let's open the

00:27.360 --> 00:28.340
User class.

00:28.350 --> 00:34.350
So this is our user model and this was added by a of.

00:34.370 --> 00:40.620
So there is this field called Hayden and it contains two entries password.

00:40.660 --> 00:51.950
And remember token so why is this inside the User model so you can also refer to the documentation link

00:51.970 --> 00:56.290
included hiding attributes from Jason.

00:56.490 --> 01:04.860
So it's extremely simple in light of all if you just convert model or collection of models to array

01:05.070 --> 01:05.670
and vars.

01:05.670 --> 01:14.850
This is being converted to Jason by specifying this protected hidden field on your models and including

01:14.910 --> 01:18.780
the column names that you would like to hide.

01:18.780 --> 01:21.120
You are telling Lavell not to include them

01:24.000 --> 01:28.680
so let's see what we would like to hide here.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.980
So we probably would like to hide deleted hard

01:36.500 --> 01:45.080
so let's go to our comment and add this protected hidden.

01:45.140 --> 01:55.880
This has to be an array so we don't want deleted art but also we do not want commendable type us.

01:55.970 --> 01:59.570
This is not really interesting commendable type.

01:59.570 --> 02:06.400
So our front end doesn't really need to know because it already expects from this end point to return

02:06.410 --> 02:07.900
comments for blog posts.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.580
So this is totally not interesting.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.790
What's the class name for this comment.

02:15.960 --> 02:29.880
Now this commendable idea might also not be very useful so let's also hide it commendable idea because

02:29.970 --> 02:38.670
this is our blog post idea and we already provided the blog post idea in the URL so we do not need that.

02:39.160 --> 02:39.530
Okay.

02:39.540 --> 02:48.810
After making these changes to the comment now every time you will convert our model to an array which

02:48.930 --> 02:53.430
in this case a lot of it is doing for us it is converting our collection.

02:53.430 --> 03:00.630
And as you remember from the last lecture that collection in turn converts every element of this collection

03:00.780 --> 03:01.750
to an array.

03:01.860 --> 03:11.250
Using that to Array method using this setting you are telling Lavell how this model should be converted

03:11.580 --> 03:14.070
to an array and then to Jason.

03:14.070 --> 03:23.610
So you are ignoring this fields so if you will make this request again now we can see that those fields

03:23.700 --> 03:25.780
are not returned anymore.

03:27.310 --> 03:29.520
So nothing really bad happened.

03:29.530 --> 03:36.160
If we would return those fields that would be just excessive data then probably not anyone should ever

03:36.160 --> 03:36.610
see.

03:37.390 --> 03:45.520
But this has some well most important use cases is where you actually have some data on the model that

03:45.820 --> 03:55.720
should never ever be returned back to publicly visible API so like imagine you would like to load our

03:55.720 --> 03:59.500
user profile by having an end point.

03:59.530 --> 04:06.880
And if you would not hide their password or remember token what you are doing is basically providing

04:06.960 --> 04:14.020
all the user passwords through an API for let's say everyone who is viewing a user profile.

04:14.170 --> 04:21.420
So it's really important to take a good look at what you are actually returning through your API.

04:21.850 --> 04:29.290
If you use this simple method of serialized models or collections but I would like to remind you that

04:29.290 --> 04:36.610
there is also are much better recommended way but that will cover later and it is called Creating resource

04:36.610 --> 04:43.810
classes for every model and sometimes a couple of resource classes depending on what information from

04:43.810 --> 04:45.690
a model you need.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.110
But we will get to that later.
