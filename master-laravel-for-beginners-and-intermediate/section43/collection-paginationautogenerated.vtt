In their last lecture we have removed this wrapping with that data as the top most property of the returned

00:08.360 --> 00:08.990
Jason.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.220
So now you just get an array with all the resources serialized to Jason but this is not being always

00:17.760 --> 00:23.750
returned without wrapping and one of the cases is where you use power nation.

00:23.790 --> 00:30.750
So that's a very useful thing to split the resources the collection of resources that you are returning

00:30.750 --> 00:32.000
into some chunks.

00:32.010 --> 00:35.160
And this makes sense when you have large collections.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.880
So how to pollinate all this resources.

00:38.880 --> 00:45.510
It's very simple in light of all you all you have to do is to use the built in Boggy Nate method.

00:45.930 --> 00:51.600
So you will call that instead of the Get because Geb is returning the whole collection.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.830
So let's check it out.

00:53.040 --> 01:01.990
So we'll just call pollinate and now even though you have disabled wrapping for all resources you still

01:01.990 --> 01:04.050
get that data parameter.

01:04.210 --> 01:09.670
And the reason for that is that when you putting out your collection it has to contain some additional

01:09.670 --> 01:10.560
information.

01:10.570 --> 01:18.880
And this is actually very useful because you've got links and this is a link to display all the comments

01:19.000 --> 01:23.260
from the page one which is the first page from the last page.

01:23.260 --> 01:29.920
Notice this additional page parameter that is automatically being appended to the URL stub a lot of

01:29.920 --> 01:30.970
it is returning.

01:30.970 --> 01:39.400
So this means you can simply use this you URLs and specify a page parameter and then a lot of VO will

01:39.490 --> 01:47.610
automatically split this collection and get only those elements that match the actual page of the results.

01:47.710 --> 01:53.500
Then there is the additional metadata which is containing the current page.

01:53.500 --> 02:00.360
This from and two parameters which specify how many items you actually have in this page.

02:00.490 --> 02:06.140
The last page parameter per page and the total number of elements.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.650
So that's actually very useful.

02:08.650 --> 02:14.540
Now in this case we happen to have only seven comments for this particular comment.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.800
So well if you have less than seven.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.340
Just try to find a blog post that has more comments so you can do something useful with this lecture

02:25.080 --> 02:29.920
and the how to configure how many elements you want per page.

02:29.920 --> 02:37.990
This is I think you will probably often like to use so it's very simple you just need to pass a parameter

02:37.990 --> 02:44.370
of the first parameter to plug in it is actually specifying how many items you want per page specified

02:44.430 --> 02:47.210
five save the changes.

02:47.220 --> 02:55.320
And now let's see what do we get now actually you can see that the last page E two which means we have

02:55.320 --> 03:00.470
two pages and this are the first five comments.

03:00.630 --> 03:07.030
So to get to the next page let's copy this URL and open this link in the next stop.

03:07.050 --> 03:16.290
But this time will specify a page parameter and now we should only have to comment resources and also

03:16.290 --> 03:19.800
it should be visible that we are on the page too.

03:19.830 --> 03:27.480
So this is actually magical in light of all the only thing you had to do e to call the pudgy Nate on

03:27.480 --> 03:28.830
the query.

03:28.920 --> 03:35.910
And because this works on the local level so it's not that you get all the elements are returned and

03:35.910 --> 03:43.820
then on the lava in P B tries to split this into chunks it actually is producing specific queries.

03:43.850 --> 03:46.980
So you are not fetching excessive elements.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.470
It does this on deck where a level.
