00:00.930 --> 00:08.820
Now before we move to the database seeding concept let's first run our tests and see if they still do

00:08.820 --> 00:09.300
work.

00:09.330 --> 00:17.070
So remember that we are running our tests using the obscure light database not the one we are using

00:17.070 --> 00:19.980
for our application which is my askew url.

00:20.010 --> 00:28.800
So there are certain differences and some of this behavior of the school like database might be different.

00:28.800 --> 00:36.450
So after running the tests you can see that we have a lot of errors and it seems to be a recurring error

00:36.930 --> 00:41.960
that you cannot add are not new column with default value.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.560
No.

00:43.560 --> 00:53.220
So this relates to our latest migration where we are the user I.D. column which is not new at all but

00:53.240 --> 01:00.630
in Eskew a light you cannot add a note no column without specifying our default value even if the table

01:00.660 --> 01:02.010
is empty.

01:02.010 --> 01:09.210
So we had that problem before with my school database but then we had records inside the database and

01:09.210 --> 01:15.770
now the database is to recreate it every time we run our specific test.

01:15.810 --> 01:23.970
Well it is automatically recreated by Lavell but it complains about this particular case that we create

01:24.300 --> 01:29.240
not no column and do not specify our default value.

01:29.880 --> 01:37.980
So to walk around this error we might use the same construct as we used in different migrations to check

01:38.010 --> 01:39.440
the environment.

01:39.450 --> 01:44.120
D.B. connection if it is askew l like testing.

01:44.400 --> 01:52.030
So let's copy this fragment here and do specific migration for that obscure light.

01:52.290 --> 01:56.290
So let's move this as the.

01:56.300 --> 02:05.890
Behavior for anything else than the obscure light tests and for school light tests will provide a dummy

02:06.010 --> 02:09.580
default value since this column is an integer.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.100
We can specify zero

02:14.840 --> 02:19.220
and now after making this change our tests will run.

02:19.220 --> 02:25.190
So this is just our short lecture about this particular problem in school light.

02:25.190 --> 02:29.780
And now let's go and work on the database seeding.
