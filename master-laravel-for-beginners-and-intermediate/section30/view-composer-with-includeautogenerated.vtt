00:00.630 --> 00:08.040
In the last lecture we've learned about the concept of view composers and thanks to that we made some

00:08.040 --> 00:16.200
data available under a particular variable names inside view templates to specific views.

00:16.260 --> 00:23.070
In our case we made that available to the Post's index view.

00:23.070 --> 00:32.060
We set that inside the app service provider that The View posts index should use the activity composer

00:32.100 --> 00:39.720
which in turn is fetching their most active users most commented blog posts and most active users last

00:39.720 --> 00:44.330
month and under those names those variable names.

00:44.370 --> 00:50.430
It is now available inside every inside this post's index view.

00:50.430 --> 00:58.260
Now I have also said that we would like to make this available on the right side when you see one blog

00:58.260 --> 00:59.430
post.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.550
So let's see how we can approach that using everything that we have learned so far.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.520
So we are not introducing anything new.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.830
We will use everything that we should already know

01:13.730 --> 01:14.030
now.

01:14.030 --> 01:22.280
Previously we created our forum for editing and adding a blog post and we've used that include directive

01:22.700 --> 01:32.000
which allowed us to display some content inside particular views and just display everything that was

01:32.090 --> 01:34.690
inside our particular helper template.

01:34.700 --> 01:41.630
Let's call it a HAMP helper template underscore a forum and it also inherited all the variables that

01:41.630 --> 01:44.070
this power interview had.

01:44.090 --> 01:55.010
Now we can use the same technique for our index blade that actually this view is called Post index and

01:55.010 --> 02:01.790
now we have also this show blade BHP where we display our one blog post.

02:01.790 --> 02:09.370
So first let us go ahead and create a new helper template inside the Post's namespace.

02:09.410 --> 02:16.150
We can call it activity blade BHP or underscore activity blade BHP.

02:16.340 --> 02:23.600
That's a good convention to call your help our templates that you only include somewhere starting with

02:23.600 --> 02:24.690
an underscore.

02:25.420 --> 02:35.010
Okay press enter and now what we will do is let's open this index template for posts.

02:35.710 --> 02:41.960
And here we decided previously that we'll use some columns of the bootstrap.

02:41.960 --> 02:53.060
And here we inserted our container to put this data into separate rows so let's just cut all this content.

02:54.810 --> 03:02.610
From that index template and moved that to the activity template.

03:02.710 --> 03:09.080
Now we might reformat that to be more clear what is inside this template.

03:09.100 --> 03:09.990
OK.

03:10.180 --> 03:16.630
So we are assuming that in every template that will include this activity partial template it will have

03:16.660 --> 03:20.500
access to those variables.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.410
So let's go ahead and do that.

03:23.050 --> 03:30.950
So we can call include posts activity.

03:31.150 --> 03:36.940
Now we do not have to pass anything else as you've seen inside the create dot.

03:37.060 --> 03:43.750
We only have to add the include directive the name of the partial template and every variable that was

03:43.780 --> 03:52.730
available to this post's index view will be available also inside that posts underscore activity.

03:52.780 --> 04:01.750
Now this made this template a lot shorter but what we are missing is inside the show blade BHP.

04:01.750 --> 04:13.930
We do not have the columns system that we have other to the index template so let's add it here to.

04:14.180 --> 04:17.090
Now we will need to reformat this a little bit

04:23.190 --> 04:23.640
OK.

04:23.650 --> 04:26.590
Let's close the deal with the first column

04:31.280 --> 04:39.210
and here will add another column that let's say would be of the with for so deep.

04:39.210 --> 04:44.630
Class call for and close this deal.

04:45.650 --> 04:53.420
Now what we will do inside this show template is exactly what we did inside index templates so we are

04:53.420 --> 04:56.630
just including a partial template

04:59.770 --> 05:00.850
now save the changes.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.090
That's not everything that we will have to do.

05:03.340 --> 05:05.530
But now let's see what do we get.

05:05.800 --> 05:10.960
So first let's go to the blog post list to see if that still works.

05:10.960 --> 05:20.350
Also let's find our tag click it to see if we can still see this panel on the right so we can.

05:20.350 --> 05:24.090
Now let's go to the blog post.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.640
Now wait until it loads and.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.100
Well what we see is undefined variable.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.350
Most commented.

05:31.420 --> 05:42.760
So actually I expected this and to solve it you have to define another view that will be to which this

05:42.850 --> 05:47.260
variables from this activity composer will be available.

05:47.320 --> 05:53.950
So as I've said the composer method specifies two world views those data would be available.

05:53.980 --> 05:58.210
So instead of just passing a string you can pass an array

06:00.840 --> 06:08.010
and add the missing view which is posts show and that's it.

06:08.020 --> 06:10.280
Now you just have to save the changes.

06:10.360 --> 06:17.040
Refresh this page and after it loads will see the same thing.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.280
What we had inside the least of blog posts.

06:20.310 --> 06:30.960
So on the right we have this panel that is fetching the data from the same place from the activity composer.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.040
And it's also cached.

06:32.040 --> 06:39.320
So basically we are not doing any more queries to fetch these data now using composers is a great idea

06:39.360 --> 06:46.850
and also specifying inside one of your service providers of course don't worry about service providers

06:46.860 --> 06:47.480
right now.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.090
I haven't really explained them yet.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.200
We'll do that later.

06:52.260 --> 06:58.410
Now inside the app service provider we've listed the only views that we want this data to be available

06:58.410 --> 07:06.000
in because well this makes sense sometimes you might want all the data to be shown on all the templates

07:06.480 --> 07:11.460
but in our example we do not want that on a home page or contact page.

07:11.460 --> 07:19.350
And specifically we do not want that on the register or logging page now but if you would like to make

07:19.350 --> 07:27.810
this available for all their views what you will do instead is you will call this method.

07:27.810 --> 07:33.920
This composer method with one string argument and an asterisk.

07:34.020 --> 07:42.870
So this will make data from activity composer available in every single larval view that you will create.

07:42.870 --> 07:46.170
So let's comment that out because we want need that.

07:46.680 --> 07:54.150
But anyway this is the way you would make this available only to specific views instead of just passing

07:54.150 --> 07:57.990
a string you will pass an array of the few names.
