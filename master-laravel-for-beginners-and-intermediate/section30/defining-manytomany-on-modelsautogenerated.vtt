In the last lecture we have created two migrations one for the new tack model and also we have created

00:08.030 --> 00:16.910
a migration for our pivot or intermediate table that will hold hold the relation between those two models.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.300
Now let's define the relation on the models itself.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.680
So a lot of us can query and associate those two models.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.510
So first we'll add method on the blog post and call it tags.

00:31.530 --> 00:36.000
So this implies that this will hold multiple models.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.880
Now will redefine return this.

00:39.030 --> 00:46.710
And the method you should use for the many to many relationship is belongs to many.

00:46.890 --> 00:50.010
The first argument is the model it is related to.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.090
So we will just use up tag.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.700
Now you should also define this relation.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.280
On the other side inside the tag models so let's add the public function.

01:02.280 --> 01:12.670
This will relate to multiple blog posts and also on the other side will do belongs to many and this

01:12.670 --> 01:16.340
relates to up slash blog posts.

01:16.930 --> 01:21.670
So notice how we define our Many to Many relationship on both models.

01:21.670 --> 01:25.070
You are using that belongs to many method.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.010
Now this belongs to many method has some additional arguments.

01:30.010 --> 01:37.060
So the first one is of course the model name of the relation but the second one is the table name.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.080
And this refers to the pivot table name.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.300
The one that we created our migration for.

01:43.300 --> 01:51.520
So by default lot of us will try to guess the name of those table that should be given and based on

01:51.520 --> 01:58.090
their model names how it converts them to underscores where there is another uppercase letter starting

01:58.690 --> 02:05.050
and then adds an underscore for the next model and also all the models have the lower case singular

02:05.050 --> 02:06.490
names.

02:06.490 --> 02:12.010
Now if you need something else you for example would like to name your table differently.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.970
You can define that using the second argument.

02:15.010 --> 02:22.450
So here you can give a different table name if you created a migration with a different table name.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.020
Now the next arguments.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.650
First one is the foreign pivot key and another one related pivot key.

02:30.130 --> 02:39.700
So this refers to the column names on the pivot table so as we see we have defined those using what

02:39.700 --> 02:43.660
larva will try to guess which is first is the blog post idea.

02:43.900 --> 02:48.490
And second is the tag idea if you need to call them differently.

02:48.490 --> 02:54.520
This is where you configure that so for the first argument you will specify something else than blog

02:54.520 --> 02:55.480
post idea.

02:55.510 --> 03:00.370
For example a blog idea or post idea whatever you like.

03:00.370 --> 03:08.350
And as the fourth argument you will specify something instead of the default tag idea that can be whatever.

03:08.350 --> 03:15.160
Now if you will specify those arguments so you want something different than the default on the first

03:15.160 --> 03:18.130
relation inside the blog post model.

03:18.130 --> 03:24.810
You will also have to do that on the another side of the relation inside the tag model.

03:24.880 --> 03:31.600
Now in the next lecture we will see how we can associate those two models and how we can query those

03:31.600 --> 03:35.860
relationships from both the blog post and tag models.
