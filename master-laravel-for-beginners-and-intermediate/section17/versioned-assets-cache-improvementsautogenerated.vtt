00:01.380 --> 00:10.200
So, you know, you can use that as a helper to include assets, sometimes people add suffixes to the

00:10.200 --> 00:18.090
asset file names after changing them to make sure browsers will fetch the updated assets instead of

00:18.090 --> 00:19.500
serving the cached ones.

00:20.250 --> 00:26.700
Laravel Meeks does that for you automatically, but you need to make some changes in the mix config

00:26.850 --> 00:27.900
file first.

00:29.390 --> 00:33.050
So open the Watpac Meeks, James.

00:36.090 --> 00:45.450
The mix variable contains the Laravel mix object, one of its methods called version will make sure

00:45.450 --> 00:54.060
your assets get a unique hash appended to the acid filenames every time you make changes to those files

00:54.750 --> 00:57.030
after they are re compiled.

00:58.380 --> 01:06.120
It's good to know this feature is only really usable in production, so we can conditionally enable

01:06.120 --> 01:06.390
it.

01:08.350 --> 01:15.880
By first checking if we are in production mode, by calling mix in production method.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.150
So you would do if mix in production.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.960
And only then we will call Meek's version.

01:33.400 --> 01:41.620
The final step is to replace the Assad helper with the mix helper in the blade template.

01:46.090 --> 01:52.000
It's the mix helper function job to figure out the proper filename with the suffix.

01:56.070 --> 02:03.660
Since the versioning will only work in production to compile production assets, we need to run NPM

02:03.660 --> 02:05.280
run PRAD Command.

02:10.340 --> 02:17.330
Notice how the output files are significantly smaller in size than when compiling for the development

02:17.350 --> 02:18.350
environment.

02:19.460 --> 02:25.400
Then let's switch to the browser and make sure you refresh the page.

02:26.840 --> 02:36.320
Then take a look at the network tab and the file names now have an ID parameter added that makes the

02:36.320 --> 02:39.230
names unique after they are changed.

02:40.530 --> 02:47.610
So in summary, if you do use versioning, you need to remember to use the mix Helbert to include your

02:47.610 --> 02:48.530
assets.

02:48.870 --> 02:52.380
If you don't want this feature, stick to the asset function.

02:53.010 --> 02:55.890
I would recommend using the versioning feature.
