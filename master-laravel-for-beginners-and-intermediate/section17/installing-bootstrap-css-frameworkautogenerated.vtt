In this course, we will use that Bootstrap CCWs framework to add some style to this simple tutorial

00:08.410 --> 00:15.910
application, we have notes the course does not cover the bootstrap framework itself in detail, but

00:15.910 --> 00:21.490
what you will learn should be enough for you to understand the basics and pick up a finger to their

00:21.490 --> 00:25.270
choice was dictated by the popularity of this framework.

00:26.080 --> 00:34.570
Laravel has tools to install basic scaffolding for different UI tools, siestas frameworks like bootstrap

00:34.570 --> 00:38.590
or JavaScript frameworks, namely view or react.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.720
We will install the Laravel UI package that will do two things for us.

00:45.170 --> 00:51.100
It will set up the bootstrap framework but will also provide the authentication controller.

00:51.130 --> 00:56.450
So we would have the registration and signing in logic out of the box.

00:56.810 --> 00:59.180
But more on authentication later.

01:01.780 --> 01:08.610
Since the course is Laravel, eight based, we need to install a lot of UI version three.

01:09.610 --> 01:19.870
So in the project directory run composer require Laravel slash UI and specify an exact version.

01:23.580 --> 01:30.540
The UI component has the concept of presets, one of those is bootstrap.

01:31.580 --> 01:39.680
Now you can run by artisan UI bootstrap to configure bootstrap.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.290
Well, this is it.

01:42.950 --> 01:46.110
Bootstrap is now installed and configured.

01:46.970 --> 01:52.670
Also make sure to run BHB artisan UI comptrollers.

01:54.500 --> 02:00.860
This would generate authentication comptrollers, you will be reminded about that later, too, but

02:00.860 --> 02:02.830
it's good to have that out of the way.

02:03.970 --> 02:08.940
We are not going to see bootstrap in action in this lecture yet us.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.940
First, we need to learn how to use the Laravel mix.
