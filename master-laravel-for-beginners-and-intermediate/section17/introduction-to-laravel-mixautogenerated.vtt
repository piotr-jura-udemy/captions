Laravel comes equipped with tools for asset management, even though our application is written in their

00:10.600 --> 00:19.310
style sheet and a JavaScript asset management is done using notes G.S., the JavaScript runtime notes

00:19.330 --> 00:26.090
Jesus comes with their NPM, the note package manager for JavaScript.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.810
It is what the composer is to be.

00:29.930 --> 00:36.590

It's a tool you have to learn how to use and it is not trivial.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.180
That's why a lot of a mix exists.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.260

02:43.880 --> 02:46.930
No configuration is needed on your side.

02:48.180 --> 02:54.600
If you don't have much JavaScript or front end experience, your head may be spinning from all these

02:54.600 --> 03:02.280
buzzwords you don't have to worry for as most of these features are there for you to work transparently.

If a thing is interesting to you, you might start tinkering and learn the inner workings.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.020
But you don't have to.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.270
You can still drive and get the job done.
