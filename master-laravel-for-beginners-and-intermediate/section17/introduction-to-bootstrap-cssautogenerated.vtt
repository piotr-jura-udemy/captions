Before we start using bootstrap, let's have an overview for the complete beginners first of bootstrap

00:08.150 --> 00:13.280
ease access framework as every framework in any programming language.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.170
Its goal is to do more with less effort.

00:16.910 --> 00:25.040
It can be divided into three main groups of features, layout components and utilities.

00:26.420 --> 00:35.490
Agreed features help build responsive website layouts, most users framework's use some kind of a grid

00:35.490 --> 00:39.690
system where content is placed in rows and columns.

00:40.680 --> 00:49.350
Components are pre-built, most commonly used Web elements like buttons, drop downs, forms and similar,

00:50.250 --> 00:58.140
some of the features of the components require a little amount of JavaScript, but most are purely HTML,

00:58.260 --> 00:59.640
Anchia says based.

01:01.710 --> 01:07.330
Utilities let you use flex box colors, font style and such.

01:07.890 --> 01:16.060
You can also use utility classes to quickly apply styles to an HDMI elements without creating custom

01:16.060 --> 01:17.280
success classes.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.480
That's a very popular idea in web development.

01:20.490 --> 01:28.910
Right now, there are frameworks that use only utility classes like a very popular with lot of programmers.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.750
The Tailwind success.

01:33.020 --> 01:40.670
The best way to explore a bootstrap is to go through its documentation, and if you've never heard about

01:40.670 --> 01:45.820
the bootstrap before, it's probably what you should do sooner than later.

01:50.340 --> 01:54.570
Make sure to check out the grid section from the layout.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.640
Forms and patterns from the components.

02:04.810 --> 02:12.250
And flags from the utilities section, this is what we will use throughout this course mostly.
