Applying good looking styles to forms is very easy with vertical forms, every input element should

00:10.510 --> 00:15.840
be surrounded by a deep element and we already have that.

00:16.690 --> 00:23.860
And this development should get the form group class.

00:25.450 --> 00:29.950
The input itself gets the form control class.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.440
Let's also add a label.

00:43.760 --> 00:50.480
For attribute should point to an ID of the form element their label is bound to.

00:52.650 --> 01:01.530
Associating labels with input has benefits first, accessibility screen readers can read out loud the

01:01.530 --> 01:09.630
label for the given input element and second, clicking the label will focus on the actual input element

01:09.630 --> 01:10.560
bounce to it.

01:12.530 --> 01:17.420
Make sure you also add the ID element I'd attributes on the input element.

01:21.090 --> 01:31.290
Let's do the same with the content field, so first we add a form group to the surrounding def element.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.320
Then we are adding a label.

01:42.340 --> 01:49.330
Then the text area needs a class called Form Control and an ID.

01:50.650 --> 01:51.340
Content.

01:52.980 --> 02:00.290
Now, let's put some text into these labels, so here there is the title and then there is the content.

02:03.100 --> 02:08.440
Finally, the buttons in the create and added templates should be styled.

02:12.700 --> 02:23.200
Beaton will style this buttons using the default bootstrap button style between primary will make the

02:23.200 --> 02:27.010
buttons blue and BGN block.

02:28.610 --> 02:32.780
Will make the buttons, take the whole whiff of the containing element.

02:34.490 --> 02:39.440
You can just copy over this glass to the edit form into the input.

02:42.990 --> 02:48.080
Let's check how our refreshed form looks like right now.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.650
Now, that is what I call a makeover.
