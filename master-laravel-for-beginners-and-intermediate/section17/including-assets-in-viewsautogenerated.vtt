To include I compiled a JavaScript or txt file, you can use that as a helper first, make sure you

00:09.980 --> 00:11.720
have our only layout file.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.710
Open the ablate be.

00:16.130 --> 00:19.850
For stylesheets, use the link tag.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.770
For the JavaScript, the script tag.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.630
The path to the file should be relative to the public folder in your project.

00:34.000 --> 00:43.180
So first, with the stylesheets we are using the asset helper and the relative path is CSA slash up

00:43.180 --> 00:44.140
access.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.270
And for the script.

00:51.710 --> 00:56.300
It is just slash up, James.

00:59.850 --> 01:07.980
Make sure you the defer attributes to the script tag so the browser won't wait until the JavaScript

01:07.980 --> 01:10.290
is passed to render the page.

01:12.100 --> 01:17.380
After this simple change, let's check how the page looks like in the browser.

01:19.940 --> 01:26.240
We should immediately see a slight change in styling, and it's due to their bootstraps versus framework

01:26.390 --> 01:28.460
now being loaded and used.
