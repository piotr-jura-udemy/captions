This is a short lecture about fleg, sporks in excess, if you already understand it, you can skip

00:07.980 --> 00:08.700
this lecture.

00:09.970 --> 00:15.460
Understanding Flex, Boggs is crucial to learn how to create layouts effectively.

00:16.330 --> 00:20.490
I have created this simple page to help you understand the basics.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.230
It is available as a download in this lecture, resources.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.600
You don't have to download it right now.

00:28.900 --> 00:35.380
It's enough to just watch as we won't write any code yet, but just in case the file is there.

00:36.960 --> 00:43.650
Flex spokes layout consists of the flex container that's the one with the red border.

00:44.610 --> 00:49.110
And flex items, those are the ones with the green border.

00:50.110 --> 00:57.040
As you can see, the Flakes box is about positioning the green items inside a red item.

00:59.720 --> 01:06.800
The green items themselves can also be separate flex containers, having their own items.

01:07.850 --> 01:12.800
The basic parameter of Fleck's box container is the direction.

01:14.970 --> 01:23.040
Is either roll, so items are positioned from left to right, that's a default setting.

01:24.060 --> 01:29.750
Or column, so items are positioned from top to bottom.

01:31.130 --> 01:35.000
Each flex container has the main axis.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.350
And the cross axes.

01:39.670 --> 01:46.750
It's important to understand this as whenever you read any flex book related documentation, you will

01:46.750 --> 01:50.620
see the reference to the main axis and the cross axis.

01:52.490 --> 02:00.020
So with the default role direction, so from left to right, main axis is horizontal.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.860
And cross axis is vertical.

02:05.110 --> 02:11.680
With the column direction, so from top to the bottom is the other way around.

02:13.810 --> 02:21.820
Example, no one presents the default elements positioning on flex container with the wrong direction.

02:23.460 --> 02:27.080
Example number three with the column direction.

02:28.470 --> 02:33.660
Next, items can be aligned on both main and cross axes.

02:34.650 --> 02:44.370
The line items, property line items on the cross axes, in the example number two, you can see items

02:44.370 --> 02:46.470
are centered vertically.

02:48.850 --> 02:51.340
And in the example, number four.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.390
Items are centered horizontally.

02:56.820 --> 03:02.760
Though there is much more to flex box, you are free to explore it further by reading the great article

03:02.760 --> 03:03.830
on the end.

03:04.200 --> 03:12.210
The link can be found in lecture resources and then reading about Fleck's utility classes in Bootstrap

03:12.210 --> 03:15.630
Documentation Link is also in the resources.

03:17.180 --> 03:22.490
What you've learned so far would be enough for us to proceed with a real example.
