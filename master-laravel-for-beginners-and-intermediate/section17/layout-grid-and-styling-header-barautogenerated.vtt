00:02.530 --> 00:12.910
Finally, let's work on the layout of our application first, the main diff element should get the container

00:12.910 --> 00:13.600
class.

00:16.220 --> 00:25.250
This class is required to use bootstrap grid system container will set your main contents section to

00:25.250 --> 00:33.920
be centered and be of the specific WIFF depending on the user screen with this documentation, page

00:33.920 --> 00:44.030
explains it well, inside the container elements, you can create a grid of rows and columns, but we

00:44.030 --> 00:45.680
will be doing that later.

00:47.070 --> 00:54.090
First, let's build a navigation heather in our obligation, something like you've seen that bootstrap

00:54.090 --> 00:55.020
documentation.

00:56.660 --> 01:00.680
Let's start with a surrounding development.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.080
Then goes Heather Element with our application name.

01:08.580 --> 01:14.530
Next, a nouf element that will contain links to different pages.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.320
Let's create for.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.370
To the homepage.

01:24.930 --> 01:26.610
To the contact page.

01:29.430 --> 01:36.250
The least of the blog posts and to a forum that can create our blog post.

01:38.960 --> 01:46.670
The root helper will give these links the proper use or else, so let us feel their creative attribute

01:46.670 --> 01:48.380
of all elements.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.370
Douridas.

02:13.850 --> 02:15.470
Let's see how it's looking so far.

02:18.490 --> 02:24.760
Not the nicest design, but, hey, the links work you can navigate to every page we have.

02:27.490 --> 02:34.930
Now, let's dial the header, we will be using Fleck's box and I will type all the classes inside the

02:34.930 --> 02:40.800
chrome dev tools so you will be able to see the difference after every change.

02:41.290 --> 02:44.950
Then we will copy classes to the code editor.

02:48.340 --> 02:54.730
First, let's make the surrounding development a flex container.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.270
By adding deflects.

03:01.620 --> 03:08.520
Then Fleck's column, as we want the direction to be from top to bottom.

03:11.220 --> 03:18.990
But not always, only on smaller screens, so from medium screen end up, we want the default flex direction

03:19.170 --> 03:24.060
from left to right versus flex and roll.

03:25.720 --> 03:37.150
M.D. means more or equal 768 pixels in screen width, so this is how responsive pages are made, different

03:37.150 --> 03:40.390
styles are being applied on different screen sizes.

03:42.340 --> 03:51.970
A line items center will center items across the cross axis, whatever it currently is, then let's

03:51.970 --> 03:57.340
add some padding to this element of size free using P free.

03:59.210 --> 04:04.730
On all corners, but on bigger screens, the horizontal padding needs to be bigger, so.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.030
PEX, M.D. for.

04:13.440 --> 04:18.570
Now, let's set the white background using big white.

04:21.270 --> 04:22.620
Border on the bottom.

04:23.890 --> 04:31.420
So our border bottom class and a small shadow, so shadow s m.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.120
This is how it's currently looking.

04:37.370 --> 04:47.470
Now, let's reset the default margin on the header element by setting the margin vertical to be zero.

04:52.760 --> 05:01.370
Make this element fill the available empty space by using Ammer and the outer, but only from the medium

05:01.370 --> 05:02.360
screen size.

05:06.420 --> 05:12.360
Font should be of normal weight, so font weight normal.

05:15.630 --> 05:20.070
Then Danoff elements should get some vertical margin.

05:22.920 --> 05:30.720
But no margin from the medium screen size, so NY and zero.

05:32.410 --> 05:35.500
And a little bit bigger margin on the right side.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.540
When the screen size is medium and up.

05:44.100 --> 05:51.600
It's starting to look cool also, let's add some bottom margin to the header element.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.130
Using be free.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.320
For some spacing between their content and the header.

06:05.470 --> 06:14.350
Finally, the elements should get a general padding of size, too, and the text should be dark.

06:17.310 --> 06:24.060
So we will only change one element in here in the browser, but then we actually need to move all this

06:24.060 --> 06:26.300
changes to the code editor.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.890
So let's begin with the styles for the surrounding header element.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.920
So this styles go in here.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.280
And Heather Styles.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.890
To the other element.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.880
Navigation elements, styles.

06:58.760 --> 07:06.680
And finally, there a elliman styles, so let's paste up to every single element.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.500
Now, save the changes and when we refresh.

07:15.730 --> 07:20.320
This would be immediately styled without us having to make manual changes.

07:28.790 --> 07:36.260
Now, apparently, I've copied those elements incorrectly because this doesn't really look proper and

07:36.260 --> 07:40.730
I forgot this D to make this are Fleck's container element.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.950
Now everything should be fine.

07:43.310 --> 07:49.780
Also, notice how this header menu gets responsive when the screen is getting smaller.

07:50.300 --> 07:57.050
If you take a look at those pixels at the top of the page, you can see that the breaking point of I've

07:57.050 --> 08:00.560
described changes how the layout looks like.
