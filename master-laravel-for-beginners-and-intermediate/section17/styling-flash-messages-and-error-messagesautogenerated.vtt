00:02.000 --> 00:08.930
Finally, let's see how we can style the flash messages and form validation error messages.

00:10.230 --> 00:19.410
Four flash messages, we can use the bootstrap alert component, so add an alert and alert.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.430
Success classers.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.590
Then for the field specific areas.

00:34.020 --> 00:39.870
Add the alert and alert danger glasses.

00:41.650 --> 00:46.720
With the list of errors, we can use the least group component.

00:50.190 --> 00:55.380
The unaltered lead element gets the least group class.

00:59.030 --> 01:05.990
Every item on the list gets leased group item class.

01:07.130 --> 01:17.360
Additional least group item Danja class will make it clear that there is something wrong with the input.

01:18.970 --> 01:27.220
Then let's also add some margin bottom to this development to make it stand out from the button that

01:27.220 --> 01:28.480
submits the form.

01:30.240 --> 01:36.900
OK, so it's time to check how it looks like, let's go to a forum for adding new blog post.

01:38.050 --> 01:40.240
This is how the errors look like.

01:41.350 --> 01:46.360
If you would try to add some valid content, that would pass the validation.

01:47.710 --> 01:50.740
Now, this is our flash message in green.
