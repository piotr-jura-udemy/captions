00:00.840 --> 00:07.710
All front and libraries you need are configured inside the package JSON file of your project.

00:08.810 --> 00:12.440
It's like a composer, Jason, but for the front end.

00:13.780 --> 00:18.460
To install this, libraries, run, npm, install.

00:19.740 --> 00:27.450
This would download all libraries in their specified version to the node modules folder, and later

00:27.450 --> 00:30.210
it would create a package log file.

00:35.030 --> 00:43.640
Then to compile all the assets for the first time, run npm, run death, but not just yet, please

00:43.640 --> 00:45.680
wait until the end of the lecture.

00:46.550 --> 00:53.950
AMPM Run Command lets you run custom NPM actions defined in the package.

00:53.960 --> 00:54.950
Jason file.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.840
You can find death.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.100
Proud watch and more.

01:04.540 --> 01:13.120
And also, you can create your own the deduction compiles your assets in development mode so there are

01:13.120 --> 01:18.520
not minified it makes it easier to debug JavaScript or styles.

01:19.930 --> 01:28.150
Production is for production, so assets are minified and compiled in production mode for the fastest

01:28.150 --> 01:32.610
performance, that's not useful in your development environment.

01:35.710 --> 01:43.750
The watch action is like running the dev action, but it keeps watching for changes and recompile everything

01:43.750 --> 01:44.930
automatically for you.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.530
This is the preferred way to work.

01:48.920 --> 01:58.010
Installing and running nodes and NPM is not always painless, sometimes actions fail for strange reasons,

01:58.010 --> 01:59.640
especially on Windows.

02:00.260 --> 02:06.260
Your best bet is to make sure you run node version 12.

02:08.300 --> 02:14.540
Also, when you see errors and even though you made sure you've followed the instructions closely,

02:15.080 --> 02:23.030
don't panic, try removing the node modules folder in your project first and running NPM install again,

02:23.810 --> 02:28.310
maybe also try to look inside the Q&amp;A under the lecture.

02:29.620 --> 02:37.480
And most importantly, try copy pasting that area into Google, most of the time, you are not the only

02:37.480 --> 02:39.220
one having a specific issue.

02:39.850 --> 02:46.290
Make sure not to copy everything, though, just something that describes the error from the error log.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.320
Finally, let's run NPN run deve.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.880
If everything is fine, you will see a happy output from the terminal.

03:01.710 --> 03:10.320
You might also get a notification depending on your system and in the public folder, you will see the

03:10.350 --> 03:16.200
updates and up S.O.S files in their respective folders.

03:17.780 --> 03:24.920
This means the assets are compiled and we are now ready to include them inside our Laravel application,

03:25.340 --> 03:27.710
which is the next thing we are going to do.
