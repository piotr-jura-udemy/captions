00:01.140 --> 00:09.780
Let's work on styling the lists of posts and an individual post page, so please open the partial post

00:09.780 --> 00:15.480
blade BHP and the show Blade template from the posts folder.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.630
The post title does not need a key.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.970
And should be a header element instead.

00:31.250 --> 00:39.080
Also, we want need to present the loping features, so let's get rid of art and even styles for an

00:39.080 --> 00:43.100
element living just one style.

00:47.120 --> 00:56.360
Let's add a link pointing to the editing form and add a element styled as a button.

01:01.230 --> 01:07.560
As usual, we use the helper to generate a URL.

01:21.440 --> 01:29.480
The form should be rendered in line, so the in line bootstrap class.

01:30.610 --> 01:34.450
Then started the deleting button as the other one.

01:36.550 --> 01:41.170
So are the Biden and Biden primary classes.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.060
Let's take a look.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.880
Almost good.

01:47.710 --> 01:54.250
We need a label on this button and also some spacing between the separate entries.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.310
So let's add the added level.

02:05.100 --> 02:14.250
And this development should have an MVP free class, meaning margin bottom of the size free, by the

02:14.250 --> 02:14.670
way.

02:14.730 --> 02:18.630
It probably won't hurt to add a link to the post.

02:18.630 --> 02:19.030
Right.

02:19.770 --> 02:23.010
So let's skip you over this element.

02:24.570 --> 02:31.020
Pasted in here because, well, it actually contains almost the same code, we just need to change the

02:31.020 --> 02:38.160
action name to posts show and close the AI elements tag.

02:42.050 --> 02:44.780
All right, now save the charges.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.140
Do refresh.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.140
It seems that it works pretty nice.
